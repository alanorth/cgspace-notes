## 2016-07-01

- Add `dc.description.sponsorship` to Discovery sidebar facets and make investors clickable in item view ([#232](https://github.com/ilri/DSpace/issues/232))
- I think this query should find and replace all authors that have "," at the end of their names:

```
dspacetest=# update metadatavalue set text_value = regexp_replace(text_value, '(^.+?),$', '\1') where metadata_field_id=3 and text_value ~ '^.+?,$';
UPDATE 95
dspacetest=# select text_value from  metadatavalue where metadata_field_id=3 and text_value ~ '^.+?,$';
 text_value
------------
(0 rows)
```

- In this case the select query was showing 95 results before the update

## 2016-07-02

- Comment on DSpace Jira ticket about author lookup search text ([DS-2329](https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-2329))

## 2016-07-04

- Seems the database's author authority values mean nothing without the `authority` Solr core from the host where they were created!

## 2016-07-05

- Amend `backup-solr.sh` script so it backs up the entire Solr folder
- We *really* only need `statistics` and `authority` but meh
- Fix metadata for species on DSpace Test:

```
$ ./fix-metadata-values.py -i /tmp/Species-Peter-Fix.csv -f dc.Species -t CORRECT -m 94 -d dspacetest -u dspacetest -p 'fuuu'
```

- Will run later on CGSpace
- A user is still having problems with Sherpa/Romeo causing crashes during the submission process when the journal is "ungraded"
- I tested the [patch for DS-2740](https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-2740) that I had found last month and it seems to work
- I will merge it to `5_x-prod`
