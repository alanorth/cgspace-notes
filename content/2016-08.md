## 2016-08-01

- Add updated distribution license from Sisay ([#259](https://github.com/ilri/DSpace/issues/259))
- Play with upgrading Mirage 2 dependencies in `bower.json` because most are several versions of out date
- Bootstrap is at 3.3.0 but upstream is at 3.3.7, and upgrading to anything beyond 3.3.1 breaks glyphicons and probably more
- bower stuff is a dead end, waste of time, too many issues
- Anything after Bootstrap 3.3.1 makes glyphicons disappear (HTTP 404 trying to access from incorrect path of `fonts`)
- Start working on DSpace 5.1 → 5.5 port:

```
$ git checkout -b 55new 5_x-prod
$ git reset --hard ilri/5_x-prod
$ git rebase -i dspace-5.5
```
- Lots of conflicts that don't make sense (ie, shouldn't conflict!)
- This file in particular conflicts almost 10 times: `dspace/modules/xmlui-mirage2/src/main/webapp/themes/CGIAR/styles/_style.scss`
- Checking out a clean branch at 5.5 and cherry-picking our commits works where that file would normally have a conflict
- Seems to be related to merge commits
- `git rebase --preserve-merges` doesn't seem to help
- Eventually I just turned on git rerere and solved the conflicts and completed the 403 commit rebase
- The 5.5 code now builds but doesn't run (white page in Tomcat)

## 2016-08-02

- Ask Atmire for help with DSpace 5.5 issue
- Vanilla DSpace 5.5 deploys and runs fine
- Playing with DSpace in Ubuntu 16.04 and Tomcat 7
- Everything is still fucked up, even vanilla DSpace 5.5

## 2016-08-04

- Ask on DSpace mailing list about duplicate authors, Discovery and author text values
- Atmire responded with some new DSpace 5.5 ready versions to try for their modules

## 2016-08-05

- Fix item display incorrectly displaying Species when Breeds were present ([#260](https://github.com/ilri/DSpace/pull/260))
- Experiment with fixing more authors, like Delia Grace:

```
dspacetest=# update metadatavalue set authority='0b4fcbc1-d930-4319-9b4d-ea1553cca70b', confidence=600 where metadata_field_id=3 and text_value='Grace, D.';
```

## 2016-08-06

- Finally figured out how to remove "View/Open" and "Bitstreams" from the item view
