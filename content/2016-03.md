## 2016-03-02

- Looking at issues with author authorities on CGSpace
- For some reason we still have the `index-lucene-update` cron job active on CGSpace, but I'm pretty sure we don't need it as of the latest few versions of Atmire's Listings and Reports module
- Reinstall my local (Mac OS X) DSpace stack with Tomcat 7, PostgreSQL 9.3, and Java JDK 1.7 to match environment on CGSpace server

- Troubleshooting the issues with the slew of commits for Atmire modules in [#182](https://github.com/ilri/DSpace/pull/182)
- Their changes on `5_x-dev` branch work, but it is messy as hell with merge commits and old branch base
- When I rebase their branch on the latest `5_x-prod` I get blank white pages
- I identified one commit that causes the issue and let them know
