## 2016-03-02

- Looking at issues with author authorities on CGSpace
- For some reason we still have the `index-lucene-update` cron job active on CGSpace, but I'm pretty sure we don't need it as of the latest few versions of Atmire's Listings and Reports module
- Reinstall my local (Mac OS X) DSpace stack with Tomcat 7, PostgreSQL 9.3, and Java JDK 1.7 to match environment on CGSpace server

## 2016-03-07

- Troubleshooting the issues with the slew of commits for Atmire modules in [#182](https://github.com/ilri/DSpace/pull/182)
- Their changes on `5_x-dev` branch work, but it is messy as hell with merge commits and old branch base
- When I rebase their branch on the latest `5_x-prod` I get blank white pages
- I identified one commit that causes the issue and let them know
- Restart DSpace Test, as it seems to have crashed after Sisay tried to import some CSV or zip or something:

```
Exception in thread "Lucene Merge Thread #19" org.apache.lucene.index.MergePolicy$MergeException: java.io.IOException: No space left on device
```

## 2016-03-08

- Add a few new filters to Atmire's Listings and Reports module ([#180](https://github.com/ilri/DSpace/issues/180))
- We had also wanted to add a few to the Content and Usage module but I have to ask the editors which ones they were

## 2016-03-10

- Disable the lucene cron job on CGSpace as it shouldn't be needed anymore
- Discuss ORCiD and duplicate authors on Yammer
- Request new documentation for Atmire CUA and L&R modules, as ours are from 2013
- Walk Sisay through some data cleaning workflows in OpenRefine
- Start cleaning up the configuration for Atmire's CUA module ([#184](https://github.com/ilri/DSpace/issues/185))
- It is very messed up because some labels are incorrect, fields are missing, etc
