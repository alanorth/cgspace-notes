- Experimenting with IFPRI OAI (we want to harvest their publications)
- After reading the [ContentDM documentation](https://www.oclc.org/support/services/contentdm/help/server-admin-help/oai-support.en.html) I found IFPRI's OAI endpoint: http://ebrary.ifpri.org/oai/oai.php
- After reading the [OAI documentation](https://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html) and testing with an [OAI validator](http://validator.oaipmh.com/) I found out how to get their publications
- This is their publications set: http://ebrary.ifpri.org/oai/oai.php?verb=ListRecords&from=2016-01-01&set=p15738coll2&metadataPrefix=oai_dc
- You can see the others by using the OAI `ListSets` verb: http://ebrary.ifpri.org/oai/oai.php?verb=ListSets
