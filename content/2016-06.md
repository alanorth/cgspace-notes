- Experimenting with IFPRI OAI (we want to harvest their publications)
- After reading the [ContentDM documentation](https://www.oclc.org/support/services/contentdm/help/server-admin-help/oai-support.en.html) I found IFPRI's OAI endpoint: http://ebrary.ifpri.org/oai/oai.php
- After reading the [OAI documentation](https://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html) and testing with an [OAI validator](http://validator.oaipmh.com/) I found out how to get their publications
- This is their publications set: http://ebrary.ifpri.org/oai/oai.php?verb=ListRecords&from=2016-01-01&set=p15738coll2&metadataPrefix=oai_dc
- You can see the others by using the OAI `ListSets` verb: http://ebrary.ifpri.org/oai/oai.php?verb=ListSets
- Working on second phase of metadata migration, looks like this will work for moving CPWF-specific data in `dc.identifier.fund` to `cg.identifier.cpwfproject` and then the rest to `dc.description.sponsorship`

```
dspacetest=# update metadatavalue set metadata_field_id=130 where metadata_field_id=75 and (text_value like 'PN%' or text_value like 'PHASE%' or text_value = 'CBA' or text_value = 'IA');
UPDATE 497
dspacetest=# update metadatavalue set metadata_field_id=29 where metadata_field_id=75;
UPDATE 14
```

- Fix a few minor miscellaneous issues in `dspace.cfg` ([#227](https://github.com/ilri/DSpace/pull/227))

## 2016-06-02

- Testing the configuration and theme changes for the upcoming metadata migration and I found some issues with `cg.coverage.admin-unit`
- Seems that the Browse configuration in `dspace.cfg` can't handle the '-' in the field name:

```
webui.browse.index.12 = subregion:metadata:cg.coverage.admin-unit:text
```

- But actually, I think since DSpace 4 or 5 (we are 5.1) the Browse indexes come from Discovery (defined in discovery.xml) so this is really just a parsing error
- I've sent a message to the DSpace mailing list to ask about the Browse index definition
