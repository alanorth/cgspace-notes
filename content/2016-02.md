- Looking at some DAGRIS data for Abenet Yabowork
- Lots of issues with spaces, newlines, etc causing the import to fail
- I noticed we have a very *interesting* list of countries on CGSpace:

![CGSpace country list](../images/2016/02/cgspace-countries.png)

- Not only are there 49,000 countries, we have some blanks (25)...
- Also, lots of things like "COTE D`LVOIRE" and "COTE D IVOIRE"
