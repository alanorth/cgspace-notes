## 2020-02-02

- Continue working on porting CGSpace's DSpace 5 code to DSpace 6.3 that I started yesterday
  - Sign up for an account with MaxMind so I can get the GeoLite2-City.mmdb database
  - I still need to wire up the API credentials and cron job into the Ansible infrastructure playbooks
  - Fix some minor issues in the config and XMLUI themes, like removing Atmire stuff
  - The code finally builds and runs with a fresh install

<!--more-->

  - Now we don't specify the build environment because site modification are in `local.cfg`, so we just build like this:

```
$ schedtool -D -e ionice -c2 -n7 nice -n19 mvn -U -Dmirage2.on=true -Dmirage2.deps.included=false clean package
```

- And it seems that we need to enabled `pg_crypto` now (used for UUIDs):

```
$ psql -h localhost -U postgres dspace63
dspace63=# CREATE EXTENSION pgcrypto;
CREATE EXTENSION pgcrypto;
```

- I tried importing a PostgreSQL snapshot from CGSpace and had errors due to missing Atmire database migrations
  - If I try to run `dspace database migrate` I get the IDs of the migrations that are missing
  - I delete them manually in psql:

```
dspace63=# DELETE FROM schema_version WHERE version IN ('5.0.2015.01.27', '5.6.2015.12.03.2', '5.6.2016.08.08', '5.0.2017.04.28', '5.0.2017.09.25', '5.8.2015.12.03.3');
```

- Then I ran `dspace database migrate` and got an error:

```
$ ~/dspace63/bin/dspace database migrate

Database URL: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/dspace63?ApplicationName=dspaceCli
Migrating database to latest version... (Check dspace logs for details)

- I think I might need to update the sequences first... nope
- Perhaps it's due to some missing bitstream IDs and I need to run `dspace cleanup` on CGSpace and take a new PostgreSQL dump... nope
- A thread on the dspace-tech mailing list regarding this migration noticed that his database had some views created that were using the `resource_id` column
- Our database had the same issue, where the `eperson_metadata` view was created by something (Atmire module?) but has no references in the vanilla DSpace code, so I dropped it and tried the migration again:

```
dspace63=# DROP VIEW eperson_metadata;
DROP VIEW
```

- After that the migration was successful and DSpace starts up successfully and begins indexing
  - xmlui, solr, jspui, rest, and oai are working (rest was redirecting to HTTPS, so I set the Tomcat connector to `secure="true"` and it fixed it on localhost, but caused other issues so I disabled it for now)
  - I started diffing our themes against the Mirage 2 reference theme to capture the latest changes

## 2020-02-03

- Update DSpace mimetype fallback images from [KDE Breeze Icons](https://github.com/KDE/breeze-icons) project
  - Our icons are four years old (see [my bitstream icons demo](https://alanorth.github.io/dspace-bitstream-icons/))
- Issues remaining in the DSpace 6 port of our CGSpace 5.x code:
  - [x] Community and collection pages only show one recent submission (seems that there is only one item in Solr?)
  - [x] Community and collection pages have tons of "Browse" buttons that we need to remove
  - [x] Order of navigation elements in right side bar ("My Account" etc, compare to DSpace Test)
  - [ ] Home page trail says "CGSpace Home" instead of "CGSpace Home / Community List" (see DSpace Test)
- There are lots of errors in the DSpace log, which might explain some of the issues with recent submissions / Solr:

```
2020-02-03 10:27:14,485 ERROR org.dspace.browse.ItemCountDAOSolr @ caught exception: 
org.dspace.discovery.SearchServiceException: Invalid UUID string: 1
2020-02-03 13:20:20,475 ERROR org.dspace.app.xmlui.aspect.discovery.AbstractRecentSubmissionTransformer @ Caught SearchServiceException while retrieving recent submission for: home page
org.dspace.discovery.SearchServiceException: Invalid UUID string: 111210
```

- If I look in Solr's search core I do actually see items with integers for their resource ID, which I think are all supposed to be UUIDs now...
- I dropped all the documents in the search core:

```
$ http --print b 'http://localhost:8080/solr/search/update?stream.body=<delete><query>*:*</query></delete>&commit=true'
```

- Still didn't work, so I'm going to try a clean database import and migration:

```
$ createdb -h localhost -U postgres -O dspacetest --encoding=UNICODE dspace63
$ psql -h localhost -U postgres -c 'alter user dspacetest superuser;'
$ pg_restore -h localhost -U postgres -d dspace63 -O --role=dspacetest -h localhost dspace_2020-01-27.backup
$ psql -h localhost -U postgres -c 'alter user dspacetest nosuperuser;'
$ psql -h localhost -U postgres dspace63                               
dspace63=# CREATE EXTENSION pgcrypto;
dspace63=# DELETE FROM schema_version WHERE version IN ('5.0.2015.01.27', '5.6.2015.12.03.2', '5.6.2016.08.08', '5.0.2017.04.28', '5.0.2017.09.25', '5.8.2015.12.03.3');
dspace63=# DROP VIEW eperson_metadata;
dspace63=# \q
$ psql -h localhost -U postgres -f ~/src/git/DSpace/dspace/etc/postgres/update-sequences.sql dspace63
$ ~/dspace63/bin/dspace database migrate
```

- I notice that the indexing doesn't work correctly if I start it manually with `dspace index-discovery -b` (search.resourceid becomes an integer!)
  - If I induce an indexing by touching `dspace/solr/search/conf/reindex.flag` the search.resourceid are all UUIDs...
- Speaking of database stuff, there was a performance-related update for the [indexes that we used in DSpace 5](https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/1791/)
  - We might want to [apply it in DSpace 6](https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/1792), as it was never merged to 6.x, but it helped with the performance of `/submissions` in XMLUI for us in [2018-03]({{< relref path="2018-03.md" >}})

## 2020-02-04

- The indexing issue I was having yesterday seems to only present itself the first time a new installation is running DSpace 6
  - Once the indexing induced by touching `dspace/solr/search/conf/reindex.flag` has finished, subsequent manual invocations of `dspace index-discovery -b` work as expected
  - Nevertheless, I sent a message to the dspace-tech mailing list describing the issue to see if anyone has any comments
- I am seeing that the number of important commits on the unreleased DSpace 6.4 are really numerous and it might be better for us to target that version
  - I did a simple test and it's easy to rebase my current 6.3 branch on top of the upstream `dspace-6_x` branch:

```
$ git checkout -b 6_x-dev64 6_x-dev
$ git rebase -i upstream/dspace-6_x
```

- I finally understand why our themes show all the "Browse by" buttons on community and collection pages in DSpace 6.x
  - The code in `./dspace-xmlui/src/main/java/org/dspace/app/xmlui/aspect/browseArtifacts/CommunityBrowse.java` iterates over all the browse indexes and prints them when it is called
  - The XMLUI theme code in `dspace/modules/xmlui-mirage2/src/main/webapp/themes/0_CGIAR/xsl/preprocess/browse.xsl` calls the template because the id of the div matches "aspect.browseArtifacts.CommunityBrowse.list.community-browse"
  - I checked the DRI of a community page on my local 6.x and DSpace Test 5.x by appending `?XML` to the URL and I see the ID is missing on DSpace 5.x
  - The issue is the same with the ordering of the "My Account" link, but in Navigation.java
  - I tried modifying `preprocess/browse.xsl` but it always ends up printing some default list of browse by links...
  - I'm starting to wonder if Atmire's modules somehow override this, as I don't see how `CommunityBrowse.java` can behave like ours on DSpace 5.x unless they have overridden it (as the open source code is the same in 5.x and 6.x)
  - At least the "account" link in the sidebar is overridden in our 5.x branch because Atmire copied a modified `Navigation.java` to the local xmlui modules folder... so that explains that (and it's easy to replicate in 6.x)

## 2020-02-05

- UptimeRobot told me that AReS Explorer crashed last night, so I logged into it, ran all updates, and rebooted it
- Testing Discovery indexing speed on my local DSpace 6.3:

```
$ time schedtool -D -e ~/dspace63/bin/dspace index-discovery -b
schedtool -D -e ~/dspace63/bin/dspace index-discovery -b  3771.78s user 93.63s system 41% cpu 2:34:19.53 total
schedtool -D -e ~/dspace63/bin/dspace index-discovery -b  3360.28s user 82.63s system 38% cpu 2:30:22.07 total
schedtool -D -e ~/dspace63/bin/dspace index-discovery -b  4678.72s user 138.87s system 42% cpu 3:08:35.72 total
schedtool -D -e ~/dspace63/bin/dspace index-discovery -b  3334.19s user 86.54s system 35% cpu 2:41:56.73 total
```

- DSpace 5.8 was taking about 1 hour (or less on this laptop), so this is 2-3 times longer!

```
$ time schedtool -D -e ~/dspace/bin/dspace index-discovery -b
schedtool -D -e ~/dspace/bin/dspace index-discovery -b  299.53s user 69.67s system 20% cpu 30:34.47 total
schedtool -D -e ~/dspace/bin/dspace index-discovery -b  270.31s user 69.88s system 19% cpu 29:01.38 total
```

- Checking out the DSpace 6.x REST API query client
  - There is a [tutorial](https://terrywbrady.github.io/restReportTutorial/intro) that explains how it works and I see it is very powerful because you can export a CSV of results in order to fix and re-upload them with batch import!
  - Custom queries can be added in `dspace-rest/src/main/webapp/static/reports/restQueryReport.js`
- I noticed two new bots in the logs with the following user agents:
  - `Jersey/2.6 (HttpUrlConnection 1.8.0_152)`
  - `magpie-crawler/1.1 (U; Linux amd64; en-GB; +http://www.brandwatch.net)`
- I filed an [issue to add Jersey to the COUNTER-Robots](https://github.com/atmire/COUNTER-Robots/issues/30) list
- Peter noticed that the statlets on community, collection, and item pages aren't working on CGSpace
  - I thought it might be related to the fact that the yearly sharding didn't complete successfully this year so the `statistics-2019` core is empty
  - I removed the `statistics-2019` core and had to restart Tomcat like six times before all cores would load properly (ugh!!!!)
  - After that the statlets were working properly...
- Run all system updates on DSpace Test (linode19) and restart it

## 2020-02-06

- I sent a mail to the dspace-tech mailing list asking about slow Discovery indexing speed in DSpace 6
- I destroyed my PostgreSQL 9.6 containers and re-created them using PostgreSQL 10 to see if there are any speedups with DSpace 6.x:

```
$ podman pull postgres:10-alpine
$ podman run --name dspacedb10 -v dspacedb_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -p 5432:5432 -d postgres:10-alpine
$ createuser -h localhost -U postgres --pwprompt dspacetest
$ createdb -h localhost -U postgres -O dspacetest --encoding=UNICODE dspacetest
$ createdb -h localhost -U postgres -O dspacetest --encoding=UNICODE dspace63
$ psql -h localhost -U postgres -c 'alter user dspacetest superuser;'
$ pg_restore -h localhost -U postgres -d dspacetest -O --role=dspacetest -h localhost ~/Downloads/cgspace_2020-02-06.backup
$ pg_restore -h localhost -U postgres -d dspace63 -O --role=dspacetest -h localhost ~/Downloads/cgspace_2020-02-06.backup
$ psql -h localhost -U postgres -f ~/src/git/DSpace/dspace/etc/postgres/update-sequences.sql dspacetest
$ psql -h localhost -U postgres -f ~/src/git/DSpace/dspace/etc/postgres/update-sequences.sql dspace63
$ psql -h localhost -U postgres -c 'alter user dspacetest nosuperuser;'
$ psql -h localhost -U postgres dspace63                               
dspace63=# CREATE EXTENSION pgcrypto;
dspace63=# DELETE FROM schema_version WHERE version IN ('5.0.2015.01.27', '5.6.2015.12.03.2', '5.6.2016.08.08', '5.0.2017.04.28', '5.0.2017.09.25', '5.8.2015.12.03.3');
dspace63=# DROP VIEW eperson_metadata;
dspace63=# \q
```

- I purged ~33,000 hits from the "Jersey/2.6" bot in CGSpace's statistics using my `check-spider-hits.sh` script:

```
$ ./check-spider-hits.sh -d -p -f /tmp/jersey -s statistics -u http://localhost:8081/solr
$ for year in 2018 2017 2016 2015; do ./check-spider-hits.sh -d -p -f /tmp/jersey -s "statistics-${year}" -u http://localhost:8081/solr; done
```

- I noticed another user agen in the logs that we should add to the list:

```
ReactorNetty/0.9.2.RELEASE
```

- I made [an issue on the COUNTER-Robots repository](https://github.com/atmire/COUNTER-Robots/issues/31)
- I found a [nice tool for exporting and importing Solr records](https://github.com/freedev/solr-import-export-json) and it seems to workfor exporting our 2019 stats from the large statistics core!

```
$ ./run.sh -s http://localhost:8081/solr/statistics -a export -o /tmp/statistics-2019-01.json -f 'dateYearMonth:2019-01' -k uid
$ ls -lh /tmp/statistics-2019-01.json
-rw-rw-r-- 1 aorth aorth 3.7G Feb  6 09:26 /tmp/statistics-2019-01.json
```

- Then I tested importing this by creating a new core in my development environment:

```
$ curl 'http://localhost:8080/solr/admin/cores?action=CREATE&name=statistics-2019&instanceDir=/home/aorth/dspace/solr/statistics&dataDir=/home/aorth/dspace/solr/statistics-2019/data'
$ ./run.sh -s http://localhost:8080/solr/statistics-2019 -a import -o ~/Downloads/statistics-2019-01.json -k uid
```

- This imports the records into the core, but DSpace can't see them, and when I restart Tomcat the core is not seen by Solr...
- I got the core to load by adding it to `dspace/solr/solr.xml` manually, ie:

```
  <cores adminPath="/admin/cores">
  ...
    <core name="statistics" instanceDir="statistics" />
    <core name="statistics-2019" instanceDir="statistics">
        <property name="dataDir" value="/home/aorth/dspace/solr/statistics-2019/data" />
    </core>
  ...
  </cores>
```

- But I don't like having to do that... why doesn't it load automatically?
- I sent a mail to the dspace-tech mailing list to ask about it
- Just for fun I tried to load these stats into a Solr 7.7.2 instance using the DSpace 7 solr config:
- First, create a Solr statistics core using the DSpace 7 config:
```
$ ./bin/solr create_core -c statistics -d ~/src/git/DSpace/dspace/solr/statistics/conf -p 8983
```

- Then try to import the stats, skipping a shitload of fields that are apparently added to our Solr statistics by Atmire modules:

```
$ ./run.sh -s http://localhost:8983/solr/statistics -a import -o ~/Downloads/statistics-2019-01.json -k uid -S author_mtdt,author_mtdt_search,iso_mtdt_search,iso_mtdt,subject_mtdt,subject_mtdt_search,containerCollection,containerCommunity,containerItem,countryCode_ngram,countryCode_search,cua_version,dateYear,dateYearMonth,geoipcountrycode,ip_ngram,ip_search,isArchived,isInternal,isWithdrawn,containerBitstream,file_id,referrer_ngram,referrer_search,userAgent_ngram,userAgent_search,version_id,complete_query,complete_query_search,filterquery,ngram_query_search,ngram_simplequery_search,simple_query,simple_query_search,range,rangeDescription,rangeDescription_ngram,rangeDescription_search,range_ngram,range_search,actingGroupId,actorMemberGroupId,bitstreamCount,solr_update_time_stamp,bitstreamId
```

- OK that imported! I wonder if it works... maybe I'll try another day

## 2020-02-07

- I did some investigation into DSpace indexing performance using flame graphs
  - Excellent introduction: http://www.brendangregg.com/flamegraphs.html
  - Using flame graphs with java: https://netflixtechblog.com/java-in-flames-e763b3d32166
  - Fantastic wrapper scripts for doing perf on Java processes: https://github.com/jvm-profiling-tools/perf-map-agent

```
$ cd ~/src/git/perf-map-agent
$ cmake     .
$ make
$ ./bin/create-links-in ~/.local/bin
$ export FLAMEGRAPH_DIR=/home/aorth/src/git/FlameGraph
$ export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk
$ export JAVA_OPTS="-XX:+PreserveFramePointer"
$ ~/dspace63/bin/dspace index-discovery -b &
# pid of tomcat java process
$ perf-java-flames 4478
# pid of java indexing process
$ perf-java-flames 11359
```

- All Java processes need to have `-XX:+PreserveFramePointer` if you want to trace their methods
- I did the same tests against DSpace 5.8 and 6.4-SNAPSHOT's CLI indexing process and Tomcat process
  - For what it's worth, it appears all the Hibernate stuff is in the CLI processes, so we don't need to trace the Tomcat process
- Here is the flame graph for DSpace 5.8's `dspace index-discovery -b` java process:

![DSpace 5.8 index-discovery flame graph](/cgspace-notes/2020/02/flamegraph-java-cli-dspace58.svg)

- Here is the flame graph for DSpace 6.4-SNAPSHOT's `dspace index-discovery -b` java process:

![DSpace 6.4-SNAPSHOT index-discovery flame graph](/cgspace-notes/2020/02/flamegraph-java-cli-dspace64-snapshot.svg)

- If the width of the stacks indicates time, then it's clear that Hibernate takes longer...
- Apparently there is a "flame diff" tool, I wonder if we can use that to compare!

## 2020-02-09

- This weekend I did a lot more testing of indexing performance with our DSpace 5.8 branch, vanilla DSpace 5.10, and vanilla DSpace 6.4-SNAPSHOT:

```
# CGSpace 5.8
schedtool -D -e ~/dspace/bin/dspace index-discovery -b  385.72s user 131.16s system 19% cpu 43:21.18 total

schedtool -D -e ~/dspace510/bin/dspace index-discovery -b  232.41s user 50.38s system 3% cpu 2:04:16.00 total

# Vanilla DSpace 6.4-SNAPSHOT
schedtool -D -e ~/dspace63/bin/dspace index-discovery -b  5112.96s user 127.80s system 40% cpu 3:36:53.98 total
schedtool -D -e ~/dspace63/bin/dspace index-discovery -b  5112.96s user 127.80s system 40% cpu 3:21:0.0 total
```

- I generated better flame graphs for the DSpace indexing process by using `perf-record-stack` and filtering out the java process:

- I sent my feedback to the dspace-tech mailing list so someone can hopefully comment.
- Last week Peter asked Sisay to upload some items to CGSpace in the GENNOVATE collection (part of Gender CRP)
  - He uploaded them here: https://cgspace.cgiar.org/handle/10568/105926
  - On a whim I checked and found five duplicates there, which means Sisay didn't even check

## 2020-02-10

- Follow up with [Atmire about DSpace 6.x upgrade](https://tracker.atmire.com/tickets-cgiar-ilri/view-ticket?id=706)
  - I raised the issue of targetting 6.4-SNAPSHOT as well as the Discovery indexing performance issues in 6.x

## 2020-02-11

- Maria from Bioversity asked me to add some ORCID iDs to our controlled vocabulary so I combined them with our existing ones and updated the names from the ORCID API:

```
$ cat ~/src/git/DSpace/dspace/config/controlled-vocabularies/cg-creator-id.xml /tmp/bioversity-orcid-ids.txt | grep -oE '[A-Z0-9]{4}-[A-Z0-9]{4}-[A-Z0-9]{4}-[A-Z0-9]{4}' | sort | uniq > /tmp/2020-02-11-combined-orcids.txt
$ ./resolve-orcids.py -i /tmp/2020-02-11-combined-orcids.txt -o /tmp/2020-02-11-combined-names.txt -d
# sort names, copy to cg-creator-id.xml, add XML formatting, and then format with tidy (preserving accents)
$ tidy -xml -utf8 -iq -m -w 0 dspace/config/controlled-vocabularies/cg-creator-id.xml
```

- Then I noticed some author names had changed, so I captured the old and new names in a CSV file and fixed them using `fix-metadata-values.py`:

```
$ ./fix-metadata-values.py -i 2020-02-11-correct-orcid-ids.csv -db dspace -u dspace -p 'fuuu' -f cg.creator.id -t correct -m 240 -d
```

- On a hunch I decided to try to add these ORCID iDs to existing items that might not have them yet
  - I checked the database for likely matches to the author name and then created a CSV with the author names and ORCID iDs:

```
dc.contributor.author,cg.creator.id
"Staver, Charles",charles staver: 0000-0002-4532-6077
"Staver, C.",charles staver: 0000-0002-4532-6077
"Fungo, R.",Robert Fungo: 0000-0002-4264-6905
"Remans, R.",Roseline Remans: 0000-0003-3659-8529

```

- Running the `add-orcid-identifiers-csv.py` script I added 144 ORCID iDs to items on CGSpace!

```
$ ./add-orcid-identifiers-csv.py -i /tmp/2020-02-11-add-orcid-ids.csv -db dspace -u dspace -p 'fuuu'
```

- Minor updates to all Python utility scripts in the CGSpace git repository
- Update the spider agent patterns in CGSpace `5_x-prod` branch from the latest [COUNTER-Robots](https://github.com/atmire/COUNTER-Robots) project
  - I ran the `check-spider-hits.sh` script with the updated file and purged 6,000 hits from our Solr statistics core on CGSpace

## 2020-02-12

- Follow up with people about AReS funding for next phase
- Peter asked about the "stats" and "summary" reports that he had requested in December
  - I opened a [new issue on AReS for the "summary" report](https://github.com/ilri/AReS/issues/13)
- Peter asked me to update John McIntire's name format on CGSpace so I ran the following PostgreSQL query:

```
dspace=# UPDATE metadatavalue SET text_value='McIntire, John M.' WHERE resource_type_id=2 AND metadata_field_id=3 AND text_value='McIntire, John';
UPDATE 26
```

## 2020-02-17

- A few days ago Atmire responded to my question about DSpace 6.4-SNAPSHOT saying that they can only confirm that 6.3 works with their modules
  - I responded to say that we agree to target 6.3, but that I will cherry-pick important patches from the `dspace-6_x` branch at our own responsibility
- Send a message to dspace-devel asking them to tag DSpace 6.4
- Udana from IWMI asked about the OAI base URL for their community on CGSpace
  - I think it should be this: https://cgspace.cgiar.org/oai/request?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=oai_dc&set=com_10568_16814

## 2020-02-19

- I noticed a thread on the mailing list about the Tomcat header size and Solr max boolean clauses error
  - The solution is to do as we have done and increase the headers / boolean clauses, or to simply [disable access rights awareness](https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/DSPACE/TechnicalFaq#TechnicalFAQ-I'mgetting%22SolrException:BadRequest%22followedbyalongqueryora%22tooManyClauses%22Exception) in Discovery
  - I applied the fix to the `5_x-prod` branch and cherry-picked it to `6_x-dev`
- Upgrade Tomcat from 7.0.99 to 7.0.100 in [Ansible infrastructure playbooks](https://github.com/ilri/rmg-ansible-public)
- Upgrade PostgreSQL JDBC driver from 42.2.9 to 42.2.10 in [Ansible infrastructure playbooks](https://github.com/ilri/rmg-ansible-public)
- Run Tomcat and PostgreSQL JDBC driver updates on DSpace Test (linode19)

## 2020-02-23

- I see a new spider in the nginx logs on CGSpace:

```
Mozilla/5.0 (compatible;Linespider/1.1;+https://lin.ee/4dwXkTH)
```

- I think this should be covered by the [COUNTER-Robots](https://github.com/atmire/COUNTER-Robots) patterns for the statistics at least...
- I see some IP (186.32.217.255) in Costa Rica making requests like a bot with the following user agent:

```
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/79.0.3945.130 Safari/537.36
```

- Another IP address (31.6.77.23) in the UK making a few hundred requests without a user agent
- I will add the IP addresses to the nginx badbots list
- Deploy latest Tomcat and PostgreSQL JDBC driver changes on CGSpace (linode18)
- Deploy latest `5_x-prod` branch on CGSpace (linode18)
- Run all system updates on CGSpace (linode18) server and reboot it
  - After the server came back up Tomcat started, but there were errors loading some Solr statistics cores
  - Luckily after restarting Tomcat once more they all came back up
