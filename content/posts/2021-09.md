## 2021-09-02

- Troubleshooting the missing Altmetric scores on AReS
  - Turns out that I didn't actually fix them last month because the check for `content.altmetric` still exists, and I can't access the DOIs using `_h.source.DOI` for some reason
  - I can access all other kinds of item metadata using the Elasticsearch label, but not DOI!!!
  - I will change `DOI` to `tomato` in the repository setup and start a re-harvest... I need to see if this is some kind of reserved word or something...
- I'm having problems using the OpenRXV API
  - The syntax Moayad showed me last month doesn't seem to honor the search query properly...
