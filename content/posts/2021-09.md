- Troubleshooting the missing Altmetric scores on AReS
  - Turns out that I didn't actually fix them last month because the check for `content.altmetric` still exists, and I can't access the DOIs using `_h.source.DOI` for some reason
  - I can access all other kinds of item metadata using the Elasticsearch label, but not DOI!!!
  - I will change `DOI` to `tomato` in the repository setup and start a re-harvest... I need to see if this is some kind of reserved word or something...
  - Even as `tomato` I can't access that field as `_h.source.tomato` in Angular, but it does work as a filter source... sigh
- I'm having problems using the OpenRXV API
  - The syntax Moayad showed me last month doesn't seem to honor the search query properly...

- Update Docker images on AReS server (linode20) and rebuild OpenRXV:

```console
$ docker images | grep -v ^REPO | sed 's/ \+/:/g' | cut -d: -f1,2 | xargs -L1 docker pull
$ docker-compose build
```

- Then run system updates and reboot the server
  - After the system came back up I started a fresh re-harvesting
