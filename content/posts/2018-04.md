## 2018-04-01

- I tried to test something on DSpace Test but noticed that it's down since god knows when
- Catalina logs at least show some memory errors yesterday:

<!--more-->

```
Mar 31, 2018 10:26:42 PM org.apache.catalina.core.ContainerBase$ContainerBackgroundProcessor run
SEVERE: Unexpected death of background thread ContainerBackgroundProcessor[StandardEngine[Catalina]] 
java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space

Exception in thread "ContainerBackgroundProcessor[StandardEngine[Catalina]]" java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
```

- So this is getting super annoying
- I ran all system updates on DSpace Test and rebooted it
- For some reason Listings and Reports is not giving any results for any queries now...
- I posted a message on Yammer to ask if people are using the Duplicate Check step from the Metadata Quality Module
- Help Lili Szilagyi with a question about statistics on some CCAFS items

## 2018-04-04

- Peter noticed that there were still some old CRP names on CGSpace, because I hadn't forced the Discovery index to be updated after I fixed the others last week
- For completeness I re-ran the CRP corrections on CGSpace:

```
$ ./fix-metadata-values.py -i /tmp/Correct-21-CRPs-2018-03-16.csv -f cg.contributor.crp -t correct -m 230 -db dspace -u dspace -p 'fuuu'
Fixed 1 occurences of: AGRICULTURE FOR NUTRITION AND HEALTH
```

- Then started a full Discovery index:

```
$ export JAVA_OPTS='-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -Xmx1024m'
$ time schedtool -D -e ionice -c2 -n7 nice -n19 dspace index-discovery -b

real    76m13.841s
user    8m22.960s
sys     2m2.498s
```

- Elizabeth from CIAT emailed to ask if I could help her by adding ORCID identifiers to all of Joseph Tohme's items
- I used my [add-orcid-identifiers-csv.py](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/alanorth/a49d85cd9c5dea89cddbe809813a7050/raw/f67b6e45a9a940732882ae4bb26897a9b245ef31/add-orcid-identifiers-csv.py) script:

```
$ ./add-orcid-identifiers-csv.py -i /tmp/jtohme-2018-04-04.csv -db dspace -u dspace -p 'fuuu'
```

- The CSV format of `jtohme-2018-04-04.csv` was:

```csv
dc.contributor.author,cg.creator.id
"Tohme, Joseph M.",Joe Tohme: 0000-0003-2765-7101
```

- There was a quoting error in my CRP CSV and the replacements for `Forests, Trees and Agroforestry` got messed up
- So I fixed them and had to re-index again!
- I started preparing the git branch for the the DSpace 5.5â†’5.8 upgrade:

```
$ git checkout -b 5_x-dspace-5.8 5_x-prod
$ git reset --hard ilri/5_x-prod
$ git rebase -i dspace-5.8
```

- I was prepared to skip some commits that I had cherry picked from the upstream `dspace-5_x` branch when we did the DSpace 5.5 upgrade (see notes on 2016-10-19 and 2017-12-17):
  - [DS-3246] Improve cleanup in recyclable components (upstream commit on dspace-5_x: 9f0f5940e7921765c6a22e85337331656b18a403)
  - [DS-3250] applying patch provided by Atmire (upstream commit on dspace-5_x: c6fda557f731dbc200d7d58b8b61563f86fe6d06)
  - bump up to latest minor pdfbox version (upstream commit on dspace-5_x: b5330b78153b2052ed3dc2fd65917ccdbfcc0439)
  - DS-3583 Usage of correct Collection Array (#1731) (upstream commit on dspace-5_x: c8f62e6f496fa86846bfa6bcf2d16811087d9761)
- ... but somehow git knew, and didn't include them in my interactive rebase!
- I need to send this branch to Atmire and also arrange payment (see [ticket #560](https://tracker.atmire.com/tickets-cgiar-ilri/view-ticket?id=560) in their tracker)
- Fix Sisay's SSH access to the new DSpace Test server (linode19)

## 2018-04-05

- Fix Sisay's sudo access on the new DSpace Test server (linode19)
- The reindexing process on DSpace Test took _forever_ yesterday:

```
$ time schedtool -D -e ionice -c2 -n7 nice -n19 dspace index-discovery -b

real    599m32.961s
user    9m3.947s
sys     2m52.585s
```

- So we really should not use this Linode block storage for Solr
- Assetstore might be fine but would complicate things with configuration and deployment (ughhh)
- Better to use Linode block storage only for backup
- Help Peter with the GDPR compliance / reporting form for CGSpace
- DSpace Test crashed due to memory issues again:

```
# grep -c 'java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space' /var/log/tomcat7/catalina.out
16
```

- I ran all system updates on DSpace Test and rebooted it
- Proof some records on DSpace Test for Udana from IWMI
- He has done better with the small syntax and consistency issues but then there are larger concerns with not linking to DOIs, copying titles incorrectly, etc

## 2018-04-10

- I got a notice that CGSpace CPU usage was very high this morning
- Looking at the nginx logs, here are the top users today so far:

```
# zcat --force /var/log/nginx/*.log /var/log/nginx/*.log.1 | grep -E "10/Apr/2018" | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 10                                                                                                   
    282 207.46.13.112
    286 54.175.208.220
    287 207.46.13.113
    298 66.249.66.153
    322 207.46.13.114
    780 104.196.152.243
   3994 178.154.200.38
   4295 70.32.83.92
   4388 95.108.181.88
   7653 45.5.186.2
```

- 45.5.186.2 is of course CIAT
- 95.108.181.88 appears to be Yandex:

```
95.108.181.88 - - [09/Apr/2018:06:34:16 +0000] "GET /bitstream/handle/10568/21794/ILRI_logo_usage.jpg.jpg HTTP/1.1" 200 2638 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; YandexBot/3.0; +http://yandex.com/bots)"
```

- And for some reason Yandex created a lot of Tomcat sessions today:

```
$ grep -c -E 'session_id=[A-Z0-9]{32}:ip_addr=95.108.181.88' dspace.log.2018-04-10
4363
```

- 70.32.83.92 appears to be some harvester we've seen before, but on a new IP
- They are not creating new Tomcat sessions so there is no problem there
- 178.154.200.38 also appears to be Yandex, and is also creating many Tomcat sessions:

```
$ grep -c -E 'session_id=[A-Z0-9]{32}:ip_addr=178.154.200.38' dspace.log.2018-04-10
3982
```

- I'm not sure why Yandex creates so many Tomcat sessions, as its user agent should match the Crawler Session Manager valve
- Let's try a manual request with and without their user agent:

```

- So it definitely looks like Yandex requests are getting assigned a session from the Crawler Session Manager valve
- And if I look at the DSpace log I see its IP sharing a session with other crawlers like Google (66.249.66.153)
- Indeed the number of Tomcat sessions appears to be normal:

![Tomcat sessions week](/cgspace-notes/2018/04/jmx_dspace_sessions-week.png)

- In other news, it looks like the number of total requests processed by nginx in March went down from the previous months:

```
# time zcat --force /var/log/nginx/* | grep -cE "[0-9]{1,2}/Mar/2018"
2266594

real    0m13.658s
user    0m16.533s
sys     0m1.087s
```

- In other other news, the database cleanup script has an issue again:

```
$ dspace cleanup -v
...
Error: ERROR: update or delete on table "bitstream" violates foreign key constraint "bundle_primary_bitstream_id_fkey" on table "bundle"
  Detail: Key (bitstream_id)=(151626) is still referenced from table "bundle".
```

- The solution is, as always:

```
$ psql dspace -c 'update bundle set primary_bitstream_id=NULL where primary_bitstream_id in (151626);'
UPDATE 1
```

- Looking at abandoned connections in Tomcat:

```
# zcat /var/log/tomcat7/catalina.out.[1-9].gz | grep -c 'org.apache.tomcat.jdbc.pool.ConnectionPool abandon'
2115
```

- Apparently from these stacktraces we should be able to see which code is not closing connections properly
- Here's a pretty good overview of days where we had database issues recently:

```
# zcat /var/log/tomcat7/catalina.out.[1-9].gz | grep 'org.apache.tomcat.jdbc.pool.ConnectionPool abandon' | awk '{print $1,$2, $3}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n

```

- In Tomcat 8.5 the `removeAbandoned` property has been split into two: `removeAbandonedOnBorrow` and `removeAbandonedOnMaintenance`
- See: https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.5-doc/jndi-datasource-examples-howto.html#Database_Connection_Pool_(DBCP_2)_Configurations
- I assume we want `removeAbandonedOnBorrow` and make updates to the Tomcat 8 templates in Ansible
- After reading more documentation I see that Tomcat 8.5's default DBCP seems to now be Commons DBCP2 instead of Tomcat DBCP
- It can be overridden in Tomcat's _server.xml_ by setting `factory="org.apache.tomcat.jdbc.pool.DataSourceFactory"` in the `<Resource>`
- I think we should use this default, so we'll need to remove some other settings that are specific to Tomcat's DBCP like `jdbcInterceptors` and `abandonWhenPercentageFull`
- Merge the changes adding ORCID identifier to advanced search and Atmire Listings and Reports ([#371](https://github.com/ilri/DSpace/pull/371))
- Fix one more issue of missing XMLUI strings (for CRP subject when clicking "view more" in the Discovery sidebar)
- I told Udana to fix the citation and abstract of the one item, and to correct the `dc.language.iso` for the five Spanish items in his Book Chapters collection
- Then we can import the records to CGSpace

## 2018-04-11

- DSpace Test (linode19) crashed again some time since yesterday:

```
# grep -c 'java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space' /var/log/tomcat7/catalina.out
168
```

- I ran all system updates and rebooted the server

## 2018-04-12

- I caught wind of an interesting XMLUI performance optimization coming in DSpace 6.3: https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-3883
- I asked for it to be ported to DSpace 5.x

## 2018-04-13

- Add `PII-LAM_CSAGender` to CCAFS Phase II project tags in `input-forms.xml`

## 2018-04-15

- While testing an XMLUI patch for [DS-3883](https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-3883) I noticed that there is still some remaining Authority / Solr configuration left that we need to remove:

```
2018-04-14 18:55:25,841 ERROR org.dspace.authority.AuthoritySolrServiceImpl @ Authority solr is not correctly configured, check "solr.authority.server" property in the dspace.cfg
java.lang.NullPointerException
```

- I assume we need to remove `authority` from the consumers in `dspace/config/dspace.cfg`:

```
event.dispatcher.default.consumers = authority, versioning, discovery, eperson, harvester, statistics,batchedit, versioningmqm
```

- I see the same error on DSpace Test so this is definitely a problem
- After disabling the authority consumer I no longer see the error
- I merged a pull request to the `5_x-prod` branch to clean that up ([#372](https://github.com/ilri/DSpace/pull/372))
- File a ticket on DSpace's Jira for the `target="_blank"` security and performance issue ([DS-3891](https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-3891))
- I re-deployed DSpace Test (linode19) and was surprised by how long it took the ant update to complete:

```
BUILD SUCCESSFUL
Total time: 4 minutes 12 seconds
```

- The Linode block storage is much slower than the instance storage
- I ran all system updates and rebooted DSpace Test (linode19)

## 2018-04-16

- Communicate with Bioversity about their project to migrate their e-Library (Typo3) and Sci-lit databases to CGSpace

## 2018-04-18

- IWMI people are asking about building a search query that outputs RSS for their reports
- They want the same results as this Discovery query: https://cgspace.cgiar.org/discover?filtertype_1=dateAccessioned&filter_relational_operator_1=contains&filter_1=2018&submit_apply_filter=&query=&scope=10568%2F16814&rpp=100&sort_by=dc.date.issued_dt&order=desc
- They will need to use OpenSearch, but I can't remember all the parameters
- Apparently search sort options for OpenSearch are in `dspace.cfg`:

```
webui.itemlist.sort-option.1 = title:dc.title:title
webui.itemlist.sort-option.2 = dateissued:dc.date.issued:date
webui.itemlist.sort-option.3 = dateaccessioned:dc.date.accessioned:date
webui.itemlist.sort-option.4 = type:dc.type:text
```

- They want items by issue date, so we need to use sort option 2
- According to the DSpace Manual there are only the following parameters to OpenSearch: format, scope, rpp, start, and sort_by
- The OpenSearch `query` parameter expects a Discovery search filter that is defined in `dspace/config/spring/api/discovery.xml`
- So for IWMI they should be able to use something like this: https://cgspace.cgiar.org/open-search/discover?query=dateIssued:2018&scope=10568/16814&sort_by=2&order=DESC&format=rss
- There are also `rpp` (results per page) and `start` parameters but in my testing now on DSpace 5.5 they behave very strangely
- For example, set `rpp=1` and then check the results for `start` values of 0, 1, and 2 and they are all the same!
- If I have time I will check if this behavior persists on DSpace 6.x on the official DSpace demo and file a bug
- Also, the DSpace Manual as of 5.x has very poor documentation for OpenSearch
- They don't tell you to use Discovery search filters in the `query` (with format `query=dateIssued:2018`)
- They don't tell you that the sort options are actually defined in `dspace.cfg` (ie, you need to use `2` instead of `dc.date.issued_dt`)
- They are missing the `order` parameter (ASC vs DESC)
- I notice that DSpace Test has crashed again, due to memory:

```
# grep -c 'java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space' /var/log/tomcat7/catalina.out
178
```

- I will increase the JVM heap size from 5120M to 6144M, though we don't have much room left to grow as DSpace Test (linode19) is using a smaller instance size than CGSpace
