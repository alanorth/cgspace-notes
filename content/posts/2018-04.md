## 2018-04-01

- I tried to test something on DSpace Test but noticed that it's down since god knows when
- Catalina logs at least show some memory errors yesterday:

<!--more-->

```
Mar 31, 2018 10:26:42 PM org.apache.catalina.core.ContainerBase$ContainerBackgroundProcessor run
SEVERE: Unexpected death of background thread ContainerBackgroundProcessor[StandardEngine[Catalina]] 
java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space

Exception in thread "ContainerBackgroundProcessor[StandardEngine[Catalina]]" java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
```

- So this is getting super annoying
- I ran all system updates on DSpace Test and rebooted it
- For some reason Listings and Reports is not giving any results for any queries now...
- I posted a message on Yammer to ask if people are using the Duplicate Check step from the Metadata Quality Module
- Help Lili Szilagyi with a question about statistics on some CCAFS items
