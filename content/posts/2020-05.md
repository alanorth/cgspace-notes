## 2020-05-02

- Peter said that CTA is having problems submitting an item to CGSpace
  - Looking at the PostgreSQL stats it seems to be the same issue that Tezira was having last week, as I see the number of connections in 'idle in transaction' and 'waiting for lock' state are increasing again
  - I see that CGSpace (linode18) is still using PostgreSQL JDBC driver version 42.2.11, and there were some bugs related to transactions fixed in 42.2.12 (which I had updated in the Ansible playbooks, but not deployed yet)
