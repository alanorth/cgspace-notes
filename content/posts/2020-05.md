## 2020-05-02

- Peter said that CTA is having problems submitting an item to CGSpace
  - Looking at the PostgreSQL stats it seems to be the same issue that Tezira was having last week, as I see the number of connections in 'idle in transaction' and 'waiting for lock' state are increasing again
  - I see that CGSpace (linode18) is still using PostgreSQL JDBC driver version 42.2.11, and there were some bugs related to transactions fixed in 42.2.12 (which I had updated in the Ansible playbooks, but not deployed yet)

- Purge a few remaining bots from CGSpace Solr statistics that I had identified a few months ago
  - `lua-resty-http/0.10 (Lua) ngx_lua/10000`
  - `omgili/0.5 +http://omgili.com`
  - `IZaBEE/IZaBEE-1.01 (Buzzing Abound The Web; https://izabee.com; info at izabee dot com)`
  - `Twurly v1.1 (https://twurly.org)`
  - `Pattern/2.6 +http://www.clips.ua.ac.be/pattern`
  - `CyotekWebCopy/1.7 CyotekHTTP/2.0`
- This is only about 2,500 hits total from the last ten years, and half of these bots no longer seem to exist, so I won't bother submitting them to the COUNTER-Robots project
- I noticed that our custom themes were incorrectly linking to the OpenSearch XML file
  - The bug [was fixed](https://jira.lyrasis.org/browse/DS-2592) for Mirage2 in 2015
  - Note that this did not prevent OpenSearch itself from working
  - I will patch this on our DSpace 5.x and 6.x branches

## 2020-05-06

- Atmire responded asking for more information about the Solr statistics processing bug in CUA so I sent them some full logs
  - Also I asked again about the Maven variable interpolation issue for `cua.version.number`, and if they would be willing to upgrade CUA to use Font Awesome 5 instead of 4.
