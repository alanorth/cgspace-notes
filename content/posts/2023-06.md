## 2023-06-02

- Spend some time testing my `post_bitstreams.py` script to update thumbnails for items on CGSpace
  - Interestingly I found an item with a JFIF thumbnail and another with a WebP thumbnail...
- Meeting with Valentina, Stefano, and Sara about MODS metadata in CGSpace
  - They have experience with improving the MODS interface in MELSpace's OAI-PMH for use with AGRIS and were curious if we could do the same in CGSpace
  - From what I can see we need to upgrade the MODS schema from 3.1 to 3.7 and then just add a bunch of our fields to the crosswalk
