## 2023-06-02

- Spend some time testing my `post_bitstreams.py` script to update thumbnails for items on CGSpace
  - Interestingly I found an item with a JFIF thumbnail and another with a WebP thumbnail...
- Meeting with Valentina, Stefano, and Sara about MODS metadata in CGSpace
  - They have experience with improving the MODS interface in MELSpace's OAI-PMH for use with AGRIS and were curious if we could do the same in CGSpace
  - From what I can see we need to upgrade the MODS schema from 3.1 to 3.7 and then just add a bunch of our fields to the crosswalk

## 2023-06-04

- Upgrade CGSpace to Ubuntu 22.04
  - The upgrade was mostly normal, but I had to unhold the openjdk package in order for `do-release-upgrade` to run:

```console
# apt-mark hold openjdk-8-jdk-headless:amd64 openjdk-8-jre-headless:amd64
```

- In [2022-11]({{< relref "2022-11.md" >}}) an upstream Java update broke the DSpace 6 Handle server so we will have to pin this again after the upgrade to Ubuntu 22.04
- After the upgrade I made sure CGSpace was working, then proceeded to upgrade PostgreSQL from 12 to 14, like I did on DSpace Test in 2023-03
- Then I had to downgrade OpenJDK to fix the Handle server using the ones I had previously downloaded for Ubuntu 20.04 because they no longer exist on Launchpad:

```console
# dpkg -i openjdk-8-j*8u342-b07*.deb
```
