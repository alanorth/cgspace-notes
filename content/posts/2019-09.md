## 2019-09-01

- Linode emailed to say that CGSpace (linode18) had a high rate of outbound traffic for several hours this morning
- Here are the top ten IPs in the nginx XMLUI and REST/OAI logs this morning:

```
# zcat --force /var/log/nginx/access.log /var/log/nginx/access.log.1 | grep -E "01/Sep/2019:0" | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 10
    440 17.58.101.255
    441 157.55.39.101
    485 207.46.13.43
    728 169.60.128.125
    730 207.46.13.108
    758 157.55.39.9
    808 66.160.140.179
    814 207.46.13.212
   2472 163.172.71.23
   6092 3.94.211.189
# zcat --force /var/log/nginx/rest.log /var/log/nginx/rest.log.1 /var/log/nginx/oai.log /var/log/nginx/oai.log.1 | grep -E "01/Sep/2019:0" | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 10
     33 2a01:7e00::f03c:91ff:fe16:fcb
     57 3.83.192.124
     57 3.87.77.25
     57 54.82.1.8
    822 2a01:9cc0:47:1:1a:4:0:2
   1223 45.5.184.72
   1633 172.104.229.92
   5112 205.186.128.185
   7249 2a01:7e00::f03c:91ff:fe18:7396
   9124 45.5.186.2
```

<!--more-->

- `3.94.211.189` is MauiBot, and most of its requests are to Discovery and get rate limited with HTTP 503
- `163.172.71.23` is some IP on Online SAS in France and its user agent is:

```
Mozilla/5.0 ((Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; fr; rv:1.9.2) Gecko/20100115 Firefox/3.6)
```

- It actually got mostly HTTP 200 responses:

```
# zcat --force /var/log/nginx/access.log /var/log/nginx/access.log.1 | grep -E "01/Sep/2019:0" | grep 163.172.71.23 | awk '{print $9}' | sort | uniq -c
   1775 200
    703 499
     72 503
```

- And it was mostly requesting Discover pages:

```
# zcat --force /var/log/nginx/access.log /var/log/nginx/access.log.1 | grep -E "01/Sep/2019:0" | grep 163.172.71.23 | grep -o -E "(bitstream|discover|handle)" | sort | uniq -c 
   2350 discover
     71 handle
```

- I'm not sure why the outbound traffic rate was so high...
