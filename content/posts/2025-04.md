## 2025-04-05

- I noticed a bunch of IPs using a weird user agent

<!--more-->

```
Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:72.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/72.0
```

- Firefox 72.0 was released in 2014 so it's suspicious
- I found a few dozen IPs from Oracle cloud, for example:
  - 151.106.160.158
  - 151.106.162.8
  - 151.106.164.53
  - 151.106.169.76
  - 151.106.184.192
  - 151.106.166.243
  - 151.106.162.30
  - 151.106.165.204
  - 151.106.191.138
  - 151.106.160.247
  - 151.106.166.201
  - 151.106.167.56
  - 151.106.163.240
  - 151.106.163.149
  - 151.106.177.184
  - 151.106.181.25
  - 151.106.180.26
- These are all AS31898, which I hadn't seen before so I will add it to my list of data center ISPs
- Sheesh, I just found some other client from another Oracle data center doing stupid stuff:

```console
# grepcidr '139.87.104.0/22' /var/log/nginx/api-access.log | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n
  39305 139.87.104.123
```

- This is AS6142 (SUN-JAVA) but AbuseIPDB calls it Oracle Public Cloud
