- While working on the CGIAR Climate Change Synthesis I learned some new tricks with OpenRefine

<!--more-->

- The first was to retrieve affiliations from OpenAlex and extract them from JSON with this GREL:

```
forEach(
  value.parseJson()['authorships'],
  a,
  forEach(
    a.parseJson()['institutions'],
    i,
    i['display_name']
  ).join("||")
).join("||")
```

- It is a nested `forEach` to extract all institutions for all authors
- Second was a better way to deduplicate lists in Jython while preserving list order:

```python
# better dedupe preserves order
seen = set()
deduped_list = [x for x in value.split("||") if x not in seen and not seen.add(x)]

return "||".join(deduped_list)
```

- Delete duplicate metadata values using the method I described in this GitHub issue: https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/issues/8253#issuecomment-1331756418

- Help IWMI with some OpenSearch RSS/Atom feeds for search results:
  - https://cgspace.cgiar.org/server/opensearch/search?query=affiliation:"International Water Management Institute" AND initiative:"Climate Resilience" AND subject:flooding
  - https://cgspace.cgiar.org/server/opensearch/search?query=affiliation:"International Water Management Institute" AND initiative:"Climate Resilience" AND subject:drought
  - https://cgspace.cgiar.org/server/opensearch/search?query=affiliation:"International Water Management Institute" AND initiative:"Climate Resilience" AND subject:landslides

- Export list of withdrawn handle redirects:

```
dspace=# \COPY (SELECT m.text_value AS handle_from, h.handle AS handle_to FROM metadatavalue m JOIN handle h on m.dspace_object_id = h.resource_id WHERE m.metadata_field_id=181 AND h.resource_type_id=2 AND h.resource_id IN (SELECT uuid FROM item WHERE in_archive AND NOT withdrawn)) to /tmp/handle-redirects.csv CSV HEADER;
COPY 400
```

- Export list of IFPRI CONTENTdm redirects:

```
dspace-# \COPY (SELECT m.text_value, h.handle FROM metadatavalue m JOIN handle h on m.dspace_object_id = h.resource_id WHERE m.metadata_field_id=28 AND m.text_value LIKE '%URL from IFPRI CONTENTdm%' AND h.resource_type_id=2 AND m.dspace_object_id IN (SELECT uuid FROM item WHERE in_archive AND NOT withdrawn)) to /tmp/ifpri.csv CSV HEADER;
COPY 10794
```

- I filed [an issue](https://github.com/DSpace/dspace-angular/issues/3258) on DSpace Angular for anonymous users to be able to export search results to CSV

## 2024-08-26

- Spent some time trying to rebase our DSpace Angular themes on top of the massive header/navbar rework from [DSpace 7.6.2](https://github.com/DSpace/dspace-angular/pull/2858)
- Spent some time getting missing bibliographic metadata (issue dates, licenses, pages, volume, issue, publisher, etc) from Crossref for CGSpace
