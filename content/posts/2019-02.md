## 2019-02-01

- Linode has alerted a few times since last night that the CPU usage on CGSpace (linode18) was high despite me increasing the alert threshold last week from 250% to 275%—I might need to increase it again!
- The top IPs before, during, and after this latest alert tonight were:

```
# zcat --force /var/log/nginx/*.log /var/log/nginx/*.log.1 | grep -E "01/Feb/2019:(17|18|19|20|21)" | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 10
    245 207.46.13.5
    332 54.70.40.11
    385 5.143.231.38
    405 207.46.13.173
    405 207.46.13.75
   1117 66.249.66.219
   1121 35.237.175.180
   1546 5.9.6.51
   2474 45.5.186.2
   5490 85.25.237.71
```

- `85.25.237.71` is the "Linguee Bot" that I first saw last month
- The Solr statistics the past few months have been very high and I was wondering if the web server logs also showed an increase
- There were just over 3 million accesses in the nginx logs last month:

```
# time zcat --force /var/log/nginx/* | grep -cE "[0-9]{1,2}/Jan/2019"
3018243

real    0m19.873s
user    0m22.203s
sys     0m1.979s
```

<!--more-->

- Normally I'd say this was very high, but [about this time last year]({{< relref "2018-02.md" >}}) I remember thinking the same thing when we had 3.1 million...
- I will have to keep an eye on this to see if there is some error in Solr...
- Atmire sent their [pull request to re-enable the Metadata Quality Module (MQM) on our `5_x-dev` branch](https://github.com/ilri/DSpace/pull/407) today
  - I will test it next week and send them feedback

## 2019-02-02

- Another alert from Linode about CGSpace (linode18) this morning, here are the top IPs in the web server logs before, during, and after that time:

```
# zcat --force /var/log/nginx/*.log /var/log/nginx/*.log.1 | grep -E "02/Feb/2019:0(1|2|3|4|5)" | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 10
    284 18.195.78.144
    329 207.46.13.32
    417 35.237.175.180
    448 34.218.226.147
    694 2a01:4f8:13b:1296::2
    718 2a01:4f8:140:3192::2
    786 137.108.70.14
   1002 5.9.6.51
   6077 85.25.237.71
   8726 45.5.184.2
```

- `45.5.184.2` is CIAT and `85.25.237.71` is the new Linguee bot that I first noticed a few days ago
- I will increase the Linode alert threshold from 275 to 300% because this is becoming too much!
- I tested the Atmire Metadata Quality Module (MQM)'s duplicate checked on the some [WLE items](https://dspacetest.cgiar.org/handle/10568/81268) that I helped Udana with a few months ago on DSpace Test (linode19) and indeed it found many duplicates!

## 2019-02-03

- This is seriously getting annoying, Linode sent another alert this morning that CGSpace (linode18) load was 377%!
- Here are the top IPs before, during, and after that time:

```
# zcat --force /var/log/nginx/*.log /var/log/nginx/*.log.1 | grep -E "03/Feb/2019:0(5|6|7|8|9)" | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 10
    325 85.25.237.71
    340 45.5.184.72
    431 5.143.231.8
    756 5.9.6.51
   1048 34.218.226.147
   1203 66.249.66.219
   1496 195.201.104.240
   4658 205.186.128.185
   4658 70.32.83.92
   4852 45.5.184.2
```

- `45.5.184.2` is CIAT, `70.32.83.92` and `205.186.128.185` are Macaroni Bros harvesters for CCAFS I think
- `195.201.104.240` is a new IP address in Germany with the following user agent:

```
Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.12; rv:62.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/62.0
```

- This user was making 20–60 requests per minute this morning... seems like I should try to block this type of behavior heuristically, regardless of user agent!

```
# zcat --force /var/log/nginx/*.log /var/log/nginx/*.log.1 | grep -E "03/Feb/2019" | grep 195.201.104.240 | grep -o -E '03/Feb/2019:0[0-9]:[0-9][0-9]' | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 20

```

- At least they re-used their Tomcat session!

```
$ grep -o -E 'session_id=[A-Z0-9]{32}:ip_addr=195.201.104.240' dspace.log.2019-02-03 | sort | uniq | wc -l
1
```

- This user was making requests to `/browse`, which is not currently under the existing rate limiting of dynamic pages in our nginx config
  - I [extended the existing `dynamicpages` (12/m) rate limit to `/browse` and `/discover`](https://github.com/ilri/rmg-ansible-public/commit/36dfb072d6724fb5cdc81ef79cab08ed9ce427ad) with an allowance for bursting of up to five requests for "real" users
- Run all system updates on linode20 and reboot it
  - This will be the new AReS repository explorer server soon

## 2019-02-04

- Generate a list of CTA subjects from CGSpace for Peter:

```
dspace=# \copy (SELECT DISTINCT text_value, count(*) FROM metadatavalue WHERE resource_type_id=2 AND metadata_field_id=124 GROUP BY text_value ORDER BY COUNT DESC) to /tmp/cta-subjects.csv with csv header;
COPY 321
```

- Skype with Michael Victor about CKM and CGSpace
- Discuss the new IITA research theme field with Abenet and decide that we should use `cg.identifier.iitatheme`
- This morning there was another alert from Linode about the high load on CGSpace (linode18), here are the top IPs in the web server logs before, during, and after that time:

```
# zcat --force /var/log/nginx/*.log /var/log/nginx/*.log.1 | grep -E "04/Feb/2019:0(5|6|7|8|9)" | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 10
    589 2a01:4f8:140:3192::2
    762 66.249.66.219
    889 35.237.175.180
   1332 34.218.226.147
   1393 5.9.6.51
   1940 50.116.102.77
   3578 85.25.237.71
   4311 45.5.184.2
   4658 205.186.128.185
   4658 70.32.83.92
```

- At this rate I think I just need to stop paying attention to these alerts—DSpace gets thrashed when people use the APIs properly and there's nothing we can do to improve REST API performance!
- Perhaps I just need to keep increasing the Linode alert threshold (currently 300%) for this host?

## 2019-02-05

- Peter sent me corrections and deletions for the CTA subjects and as usual, there were encoding errors with some accentsÁ in his file
- In other news, it seems that the GREL syntax regarding booleans changed in OpenRefine recently, so I need to update some expressions like the one I use to detect encoding errors to use `toString()`:

```
or(
  isNotNull(value.match(/.*\uFFFD.*/)),
  isNotNull(value.match(/.*\u00A0.*/)),
  isNotNull(value.match(/.*\u200A.*/)),
  isNotNull(value.match(/.*\u2019.*/)),
  isNotNull(value.match(/.*\u00b4.*/)),
  isNotNull(value.match(/.*\u007e.*/))
).toString()
```

- Testing the corrections for sixty-five items and sixteen deletions using my [fix-metadata-values.py](https://gist.github.com/alanorth/df92cbfb54d762ba21b28f7cd83b6897) and [delete-metadata-values.py](https://gist.github.com/alanorth/bd7d58c947f686401a2b1fadc78736be) scripts:

```
$ ./fix-metadata-values.py -i 2019-02-04-Correct-65-CTA-Subjects.csv -f cg.subject.cta -t CORRECT -m 124 -db dspace -u dspace -p 'fuu' -d
$ ./delete-metadata-values.py -i 2019-02-04-Delete-16-CTA-Subjects.csv -f cg.subject.cta -m 124 -db dspace -u dspace -p 'fuu' -d
```

- I applied them on DSpace Test and CGSpace and started a full Discovery re-index:

```
$ export JAVA_OPTS="-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -Xmx1024m"
$ time schedtool -D -e ionice -c2 -n7 nice -n19 dspace index-discovery -b
```

- Peter had marked several terms with `||` to indicate multiple values in his corrections so I will have to go back and do those manually:

```
EMPODERAMENTO DE JOVENS,EMPODERAMENTO||JOVENS
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT,NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT||ENVIRONMENT
FISHERIES AND AQUACULTURE,FISHERIES||AQUACULTURE
MARKETING AND TRADE,MARKETING||TRADE
MARKETING ET COMMERCE,MARKETING||COMMERCE
NATURAL RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENT,NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT||ENVIRONMENT
PÊCHES ET AQUACULTURE,PÊCHES||AQUACULTURE
PESCAS E AQUACULTURE,PISCICULTURA||AQUACULTURE
```

## 2019-02-06

- I dumped the CTA community so I can try to fix the subjects with multiple subjects that Peter indicated in his corrections:

```
$ dspace metadata-export -i 10568/42211 -f /tmp/cta.csv
```

- Then I used `csvcut` to get only the CTA subject columns:

```
$ csvcut -c "id,collection,cg.subject.cta,cg.subject.cta[],cg.subject.cta[en_US]" /tmp/cta.csv > /tmp/cta-subjects.csv
```

- After that I imported the CSV into OpenRefine where I could properly identify and edit the subjects as multiple values
- Then I imported it back into CGSpace:

```
$ dspace metadata-import -f /tmp/2019-02-06-CTA-multiple-subjects.csv
```

- Another day, another alert about high load on CGSpace (linode18) from Linode
- This time the load average was 370% and the top ten IPs before, during, and after that time were:

```
# zcat --force /var/log/nginx/*.log /var/log/nginx/*.log.1 | grep -E "06/Feb/2019:0(5|6|7|8|9)" | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 10
    689 35.237.175.180
   1236 5.9.6.51
   1305 34.218.226.147
   1580 66.249.66.219
   1939 50.116.102.77
   2313 108.212.105.35
   4666 205.186.128.185
   4666 70.32.83.92
   4950 85.25.237.71
   5158 45.5.186.2
```

- Looking closer at the top users, I see `45.5.186.2` is in Brazil and was making over 100 requests per minute to the REST API:

```
# zcat --force /var/log/nginx/rest.log /var/log/nginx/rest.log.1 | grep 45.5.186.2 | grep -o -E '06/Feb/2019:0[0-9]:[0-9][0-9]' | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 10
    118 06/Feb/2019:05:46
    119 06/Feb/2019:05:37
    119 06/Feb/2019:05:47
    120 06/Feb/2019:05:43
    120 06/Feb/2019:05:44
    121 06/Feb/2019:05:38
    122 06/Feb/2019:05:39
    125 06/Feb/2019:05:42
    126 06/Feb/2019:05:40
    126 06/Feb/2019:05:41
```

- I was thinking of rate limiting those because I assumed most of them would be errors, but actually most are HTTP 200 OK!

```
# zcat --force /var/log/nginx/*.log /var/log/nginx/*.log.1 | grep -E '06/Feb/2019' | grep 45.5.186.2 | awk '{print $9}' | sort | uniq -c
  10411 200
      1 301
      7 302
      3 404
     18 499
      2 500
```

- I should probably start looking at the top IPs for web (XMLUI) and for API (REST and OAI) separately:

```
# zcat --force /var/log/nginx/{access,error,library-access}.log /var/log/nginx/{access,error,library-access}.log.1 | grep -E "06/Feb/2019:0(5|6|7|8|9)" | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 10
    328 220.247.212.35
    372 66.249.66.221

    572 5.143.231.8
    689 35.237.175.180
    771 108.212.105.35
   1236 5.9.6.51
   1554 66.249.66.219

     10 66.249.66.221

   4661 205.186.128.185
   4661 70.32.83.92
   5102 45.5.186.2
```

## 2019-02-07

- Linode sent an alert last night that the load on CGSpace (linode18) was over 300%
- Here are the top IPs in the web server and API logs before, during, and after that time, respectively:

```
# zcat --force /var/log/nginx/{oai,rest,statistics}.log /var/log/nginx/{oai,rest,statistics}.log.1 | grep -E "06/Feb/2019:(17|18|19|20|23)" | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 10
      5 66.249.66.209
      6 2a01:4f8:210:51ef::2

      9 104.198.9.108
      9 157.55.39.192
     10 157.55.39.244
     12 66.249.66.221
     20 95.108.181.88
     27 66.249.66.219
   2381 45.5.186.2
# zcat --force /var/log/nginx/{access,error,library-access}.log /var/log/nginx/{access,error,library-access}.log.1 | grep -E "06/Feb/2019:(17|18|19|20|23)" | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 10
    455 45.5.186.2
    506 40.77.167.75
    559 54.70.40.11
    825 157.55.39.244
    871 2a01:4f8:140:3192::2
    938 157.55.39.192
   1058 85.25.237.71
   1416 5.9.6.51
   1606 66.249.66.219
   1718 35.237.175.180
```

- Then again this morning another alert:

```
# zcat --force /var/log/nginx/{oai,rest,statistics}.log /var/log/nginx/{oai,rest,statistics}.log.1 | grep -E "07/Feb/2019:0(5|6|7|8|9)" | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 10
      5 66.249.66.223
      8 104.198.9.108
     13 110.54.160.222
     24 66.249.66.219
     25 175.158.217.98
    214 34.218.226.147
    346 45.5.184.72
   4529 45.5.186.2
   4661 205.186.128.185
   4661 70.32.83.92
# zcat --force /var/log/nginx/{access,error,library-access}.log /var/log/nginx/{access,error,library-access}.log.1 | grep -E "07/Feb/2019:0(5|6|7|8|9)" | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 10
    145 157.55.39.237
    154 66.249.66.221
    214 34.218.226.147
    261 35.237.175.180
    273 2a01:4f8:140:3192::2
    300 169.48.66.92
    487 5.143.231.39
    766 5.9.6.51
    771 85.25.237.71
    848 66.249.66.219
```

- So it seems that the load issue comes from the REST API, not the XMLUI
- I could probably rate limit the REST API, or maybe just keep increasing the alert threshold so I don't get alert spam (this is probably the correct approach because it seems like the REST API can keep up with the requests and is returning HTTP 200 status as far as I can tell)
- Bosede from IITA sent a message that a colleague is having problems submitting to some collections in their community:

```
Authorization denied for action WORKFLOW_STEP_1 on COLLECTION:1056 by user 1759
```

- Collection 1056 appears to be [IITA Posters and Presentations](https://cgspace.cgiar.org/handle/10568/68741) and I see that its workflow step 1 (Accept/Reject) is empty:

![IITA Posters and Presentations workflow step 1 empty](/cgspace-notes/2019/02/iita-workflow-step1-empty.png)

- IITA editors or approvers should be added to that step (though I'm curious why nobody is in that group currently)

<!-- vim: set sw=2 ts=2: -->
