## 2019-02-01

- Linode has alerted a few times since last night that the CPU usage on CGSpace (linode18) was high despite me increasing the alert threshold last week from 250% to 275%â€”I might need to increase it again!
- The Solr statistics the past few months have been very high and I was wondering if the web server logs also showed an increase
- There were just over 3 million accesses in the nginx logs last month:

```
# time zcat --force /var/log/nginx/* | grep -cE "[0-9]{1,2}/Jan/2019"
3018243

real    0m19.873s
user    0m22.203s
sys     0m1.979s
```

<!--more-->

- Normally I'd say this was very high, but [about this time last year]({{< relref "2018-02.md" >}}) I remember thinking the same thing when we had 3.1 million...
- I will have to keep an eye on this to see if there is some error in Solr...
