## 2019-02-01

- Linode has alerted a few times since last night that the CPU usage on CGSpace (linode18) was high despite me increasing the alert threshold last week from 250% to 275%â€”I might need to increase it again!
- The top IPs before, during, and after this latest alert tonight were:

```
# zcat --force /var/log/nginx/*.log /var/log/nginx/*.log.1 | grep -E "01/Feb/2019:(17|18|19|20|21)" | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 10
    245 207.46.13.5
    332 54.70.40.11
    385 5.143.231.38
    405 207.46.13.173
    405 207.46.13.75
   1117 66.249.66.219
   1121 35.237.175.180
   1546 5.9.6.51
   2474 45.5.186.2
   5490 85.25.237.71
```

- `85.25.237.71` is the "Linguee Bot" that I first saw last month
- The Solr statistics the past few months have been very high and I was wondering if the web server logs also showed an increase
- There were just over 3 million accesses in the nginx logs last month:

```
# time zcat --force /var/log/nginx/* | grep -cE "[0-9]{1,2}/Jan/2019"
3018243

real    0m19.873s
user    0m22.203s
sys     0m1.979s
```

<!--more-->

- Normally I'd say this was very high, but [about this time last year]({{< relref "2018-02.md" >}}) I remember thinking the same thing when we had 3.1 million...
- I will have to keep an eye on this to see if there is some error in Solr...
- Atmire sent their [pull request to re-enable the Metadata Quality Module (MQM) on our `5_x-dev` branch](https://github.com/ilri/DSpace/pull/407) today
  - I will test it next week and send them feedback
