## 2019-02-01

- Linode has alerted a few times since last night that the CPU usage on CGSpace (linode18) was high despite me increasing the alert threshold last week from 250% to 275%—I might need to increase it again!
- The top IPs before, during, and after this latest alert tonight were:

```
# zcat --force /var/log/nginx/*.log /var/log/nginx/*.log.1 | grep -E "01/Feb/2019:(17|18|19|20|21)" | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 10
    245 207.46.13.5
    332 54.70.40.11
    385 5.143.231.38
    405 207.46.13.173
    405 207.46.13.75
   1117 66.249.66.219
   1121 35.237.175.180
   1546 5.9.6.51
   2474 45.5.186.2
   5490 85.25.237.71
```

- `85.25.237.71` is the "Linguee Bot" that I first saw last month
- The Solr statistics the past few months have been very high and I was wondering if the web server logs also showed an increase
- There were just over 3 million accesses in the nginx logs last month:

```
# time zcat --force /var/log/nginx/* | grep -cE "[0-9]{1,2}/Jan/2019"
3018243

real    0m19.873s
user    0m22.203s
sys     0m1.979s
```

<!--more-->

- Normally I'd say this was very high, but [about this time last year]({{< relref "2018-02.md" >}}) I remember thinking the same thing when we had 3.1 million...
- I will have to keep an eye on this to see if there is some error in Solr...
- Atmire sent their [pull request to re-enable the Metadata Quality Module (MQM) on our `5_x-dev` branch](https://github.com/ilri/DSpace/pull/407) today
  - I will test it next week and send them feedback

## 2019-02-02

- Another alert from Linode about CGSpace (linode18) this morning, here are the top IPs in the web server logs before, during, and after that time:

```
# zcat --force /var/log/nginx/*.log /var/log/nginx/*.log.1 | grep -E "02/Feb/2019:0(1|2|3|4|5)" | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 10
    284 18.195.78.144
    329 207.46.13.32
    417 35.237.175.180
    448 34.218.226.147
    694 2a01:4f8:13b:1296::2
    718 2a01:4f8:140:3192::2
    786 137.108.70.14
   1002 5.9.6.51
   6077 85.25.237.71
   8726 45.5.184.2
```

- `45.5.184.2` is CIAT and `85.25.237.71` is the new Linguee bot that I first noticed a few days ago
- I will increase the Linode alert threshold from 275 to 300% because this is becoming too much!
- I tested the Atmire Metadata Quality Module (MQM)'s duplicate checked on the some [WLE items](https://dspacetest.cgiar.org/handle/10568/81268) that I helped Udana with a few months ago on DSpace Test (linode19) and indeed it found many duplicates!

## 2019-02-03

- This is seriously getting annoying, Linode sent another alert this morning that CGSpace (linode18) load was 377%!
- Here are the top IPs before, during, and after that time:

```
# zcat --force /var/log/nginx/*.log /var/log/nginx/*.log.1 | grep -E "03/Feb/2019:0(5|6|7|8|9)" | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 10
    325 85.25.237.71
    340 45.5.184.72
    431 5.143.231.8
    756 5.9.6.51
   1048 34.218.226.147
   1203 66.249.66.219
   1496 195.201.104.240
   4658 205.186.128.185
   4658 70.32.83.92
   4852 45.5.184.2
```

- `45.5.184.2` is CIAT, `70.32.83.92` and `205.186.128.185` are Macaroni Bros harvesters for CCAFS I think
- `195.201.104.240` is a new IP address in Germany with the following user agent:

```
Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.12; rv:62.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/62.0
```

- This user was making 20–60 requests per minute this morning... seems like I should try to block this type of behavior heuristically, regardless of user agent!

```
# zcat --force /var/log/nginx/*.log /var/log/nginx/*.log.1 | grep -E "03/Feb/2019" | grep 195.201.104.240 | grep -o -E '03/Feb/2019:0[0-9]:[0-9][0-9]' | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 20

     59 03/Feb/2019:07:25
```

- At least they re-used their Tomcat session!

```
$ grep -o -E 'session_id=[A-Z0-9]{32}:ip_addr=195.201.104.240' dspace.log.2019-02-03 | sort | uniq | wc -l
1
```

- This user was making requests to `/browse`, which is not currently under the existing rate limiting of dynamic pages in our nginx config
  - I [extended the existing `dynamicpages` (12/m) rate limit to `/browse` and `/discover`](https://github.com/ilri/rmg-ansible-public/commit/36dfb072d6724fb5cdc81ef79cab08ed9ce427ad) with an allowance for bursting of up to five requests for "real" users
- Run all system updates on linode20 and reboot it
  - This will be the new AReS repository explorer server soon

## 2019-02-04

- Generate a list of CTA subjects from CGSpace for Peter:

```
dspace=# \copy (SELECT DISTINCT text_value, count(*) FROM metadatavalue WHERE resource_type_id=2 AND metadata_field_id=124 GROUP BY text_value ORDER BY COUNT DESC) to /tmp/cta-subjects.csv with csv header;
COPY 321
```

- Skype with Michael Victor about CKM and CGSpace
- Discuss the new IITA research theme field with Abenet and decide that we should use `cg.identifier.iitatheme`
- This morning there was another alert from Linode about the high load on CGSpace (linode18), here are the top IPs in the web server logs before, during, and after that time:

```
# zcat --force /var/log/nginx/*.log /var/log/nginx/*.log.1 | grep -E "04/Feb/2019:0(5|6|7|8|9)" | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 10
    589 2a01:4f8:140:3192::2
    762 66.249.66.219
    889 35.237.175.180
   1332 34.218.226.147
   1393 5.9.6.51
   1940 50.116.102.77
   3578 85.25.237.71
   4311 45.5.184.2
   4658 205.186.128.185
   4658 70.32.83.92
```

- At this rate I think I just need to stop paying attention to these alerts—DSpace gets thrashed when people use the APIs properly and there's nothing we can do to improve REST API performance!
- Perhaps I just need to keep increasing the Linode alert threshold (currently 300%) for this host?

## 2019-02-05

- Peter sent me corrections and deletions for the CTA subjects and as usual, there were encoding errors with some accentsÁ in his file
- In other news, it seems that the GREL syntax regarding booleans changed in OpenRefine recently, so I need to update some expressions like the one I use to detect encoding errors to use `toString()`:

```
or(
  isNotNull(value.match(/.*\uFFFD.*/)),
  isNotNull(value.match(/.*\u00A0.*/)),
  isNotNull(value.match(/.*\u200A.*/)),
  isNotNull(value.match(/.*\u2019.*/)),
  isNotNull(value.match(/.*\u00b4.*/)),
  isNotNull(value.match(/.*\u007e.*/))
).toString()
```

- Testing the corrections for sixty-five items and sixteen deletions using my [fix-metadata-values.py](https://gist.github.com/alanorth/df92cbfb54d762ba21b28f7cd83b6897) and [delete-metadata-values.py](https://gist.github.com/alanorth/bd7d58c947f686401a2b1fadc78736be) scripts:

```
$ ./fix-metadata-values.py -i 2019-02-04-Correct-65-CTA-Subjects.csv -f cg.subject.cta -t CORRECT -m 124 -db dspace -u dspace -p 'fuu' -d
$ ./delete-metadata-values.py -i 2019-02-04-Delete-16-CTA-Subjects.csv -f cg.subject.cta -m 124 -db dspace -u dspace -p 'fuu' -d
```

- I applied them on DSpace Test and CGSpace and started a full Discovery re-index:

```
$ export JAVA_OPTS="-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -Xmx1024m"
$ time schedtool -D -e ionice -c2 -n7 nice -n19 dspace index-discovery -b
```

- Peter had marked several terms with `||` to indicate multiple values in his corrections so I will have to go back and do those manually:

```
EMPODERAMENTO DE JOVENS,EMPODERAMENTO||JOVENS
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT,NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT||ENVIRONMENT
FISHERIES AND AQUACULTURE,FISHERIES||AQUACULTURE
MARKETING AND TRADE,MARKETING||TRADE
MARKETING ET COMMERCE,MARKETING||COMMERCE
NATURAL RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENT,NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT||ENVIRONMENT
PÊCHES ET AQUACULTURE,PÊCHES||AQUACULTURE
PESCAS E AQUACULTURE,PISCICULTURA||AQUACULTURE
```

## 2019-02-06

- I dumped the CTA community so I can try to fix the subjects with multiple subjects that Peter indicated in his corrections:

```
$ dspace metadata-export -i 10568/42211 -f /tmp/cta.csv
```

- Then I used `csvcut` to get only the CTA subject columns:

```
$ csvcut -c "id,collection,cg.subject.cta,cg.subject.cta[],cg.subject.cta[en_US]" /tmp/cta.csv > /tmp/cta-subjects.csv
```

- After that I imported the CSV into OpenRefine where I could properly identify and edit the subjects as multiple values
- Then I imported it back into CGSpace:

```
$ dspace metadata-import -f /tmp/2019-02-06-CTA-multiple-subjects.csv
```

- Another day, another alert about high load on CGSpace (linode18) from Linode
- This time the load average was 370% and the top ten IPs before, during, and after that time were:

```
# zcat --force /var/log/nginx/*.log /var/log/nginx/*.log.1 | grep -E "06/Feb/2019:0(5|6|7|8|9)" | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 10
    689 35.237.175.180
   1236 5.9.6.51
   1305 34.218.226.147
   1580 66.249.66.219
   1939 50.116.102.77
   2313 108.212.105.35
   4666 205.186.128.185
   4666 70.32.83.92
   4950 85.25.237.71
   5158 45.5.186.2
```

- Looking closer at the top users, I see `45.5.186.2` is in Brazil and was making over 100 requests per minute to the REST API:

```
# zcat --force /var/log/nginx/rest.log /var/log/nginx/rest.log.1 | grep 45.5.186.2 | grep -o -E '06/Feb/2019:0[0-9]:[0-9][0-9]' | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 10
    118 06/Feb/2019:05:46
    119 06/Feb/2019:05:37
    119 06/Feb/2019:05:47
    120 06/Feb/2019:05:43
    120 06/Feb/2019:05:44
    121 06/Feb/2019:05:38
    122 06/Feb/2019:05:39
    125 06/Feb/2019:05:42
    126 06/Feb/2019:05:40
    126 06/Feb/2019:05:41
```

- I was thinking of rate limiting those because I assumed most of them would be errors, but actually most are HTTP 200 OK!

```
# zcat --force /var/log/nginx/*.log /var/log/nginx/*.log.1 | grep -E '06/Feb/2019' | grep 45.5.186.2 | awk '{print $9}' | sort | uniq -c
  10411 200
      1 301
      7 302
      3 404
     18 499
      2 500
```

- I should probably start looking at the top IPs for web (XMLUI) and for API (REST and OAI) separately:

```
# zcat --force /var/log/nginx/{access,error,library-access}.log /var/log/nginx/{access,error,library-access}.log.1 | grep -E "06/Feb/2019:0(5|6|7|8|9)" | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 10
    328 220.247.212.35
    372 66.249.66.221
    380 207.46.13.2
    519 2a01:4f8:140:3192::2
    572 5.143.231.8
    689 35.237.175.180
    771 108.212.105.35
   1236 5.9.6.51
   1554 66.249.66.219
   4942 85.25.237.71

     10 66.249.66.221

   4661 205.186.128.185
   4661 70.32.83.92
   5102 45.5.186.2
```

## 2019-02-07

- Linode sent an alert last night that the load on CGSpace (linode18) was over 300%
- Here are the top IPs in the web server and API logs before, during, and after that time, respectively:

```
# zcat --force /var/log/nginx/{oai,rest,statistics}.log /var/log/nginx/{oai,rest,statistics}.log.1 | grep -E "06/Feb/2019:(17|18|19|20|23)" | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 10
      5 66.249.66.209
      6 2a01:4f8:210:51ef::2
      6 40.77.167.75
      9 104.198.9.108
      9 157.55.39.192
     10 157.55.39.244
     12 66.249.66.221
     20 95.108.181.88
     27 66.249.66.219
   2381 45.5.186.2
# zcat --force /var/log/nginx/{access,error,library-access}.log /var/log/nginx/{access,error,library-access}.log.1 | grep -E "06/Feb/2019:(17|18|19|20|23)" | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 10
    455 45.5.186.2
    506 40.77.167.75
    559 54.70.40.11
    825 157.55.39.244
    871 2a01:4f8:140:3192::2
    938 157.55.39.192
   1058 85.25.237.71
   1416 5.9.6.51
   1606 66.249.66.219
   1718 35.237.175.180
```

- Then again this morning another alert:

```
# zcat --force /var/log/nginx/{oai,rest,statistics}.log /var/log/nginx/{oai,rest,statistics}.log.1 | grep -E "07/Feb/2019:0(5|6|7|8|9)" | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 10
      5 66.249.66.223
      8 104.198.9.108
     13 110.54.160.222
     24 66.249.66.219
     25 175.158.217.98
    214 34.218.226.147
    346 45.5.184.72
   4529 45.5.186.2
   4661 205.186.128.185
   4661 70.32.83.92
# zcat --force /var/log/nginx/{access,error,library-access}.log /var/log/nginx/{access,error,library-access}.log.1 | grep -E "07/Feb/2019:0(5|6|7|8|9)" | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 10
    145 157.55.39.237
    154 66.249.66.221
    214 34.218.226.147
    261 35.237.175.180
    273 2a01:4f8:140:3192::2
    300 169.48.66.92
    487 5.143.231.39
    766 5.9.6.51
    771 85.25.237.71
    848 66.249.66.219
```

- So it seems that the load issue comes from the REST API, not the XMLUI
- I could probably rate limit the REST API, or maybe just keep increasing the alert threshold so I don't get alert spam (this is probably the correct approach because it seems like the REST API can keep up with the requests and is returning HTTP 200 status as far as I can tell)
- Bosede from IITA sent a message that a colleague is having problems submitting to some collections in their community:

```
Authorization denied for action WORKFLOW_STEP_1 on COLLECTION:1056 by user 1759
```

- Collection 1056 appears to be [IITA Posters and Presentations](https://cgspace.cgiar.org/handle/10568/68741) and I see that its workflow step 1 (Accept/Reject) is empty:

![IITA Posters and Presentations workflow step 1 empty](/cgspace-notes/2019/02/iita-workflow-step1-empty.png)

- IITA editors or approvers should be added to that step (though I'm curious why nobody is in that group currently)
- Abenet says we are not using the "Accept/Reject" step so this group should be deleted
- Bizuwork asked about the "DSpace Submission Approved and Archived" emails that stopped working last month
- I tried the `test-email` command on DSpace and it indeed is not working:

```
$ dspace test-email

About to send test email:
 - To: aorth@mjanja.ch
 - Subject: DSpace test email
 - Server: smtp.serv.cgnet.com

Error sending email:
 - Error: javax.mail.MessagingException: Could not connect to SMTP host: smtp.serv.cgnet.com, port: 25;
  nested exception is:
        java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused (Connection refused)

Please see the DSpace documentation for assistance.
```

- I can't connect to TCP port 25 on that server so I sent a mail to CGNET support to ask what's up
- CGNET said these servers were discontinued in 2018-01 and that I should use [Office 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/mail-flow-best-practices/how-to-set-up-a-multifunction-device-or-application-to-send-email-using-office-3)

## 2019-02-08

- I re-configured CGSpace to use the email/password for cgspace-support, but I get this error when I try the `test-email` script:

```
Error sending email:
 - Error: com.sun.mail.smtp.SMTPSendFailedException: 530 5.7.57 SMTP; Client was not authenticated to send anonymous mail during MAIL FROM [AM6PR10CA0028.EURPRD10.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM]
```

- I tried to log into Outlook 365 with the credentials but I think the ones I have must be wrong, so I will ask ICT to reset the password

## 2019-02-09

- Linode sent alerts about CPU load yesterday morning, yesterday night, and this morning! All over 300% CPU load!
- This is just for this morning:

```
# zcat --force /var/log/nginx/{access,error,library-access}.log /var/log/nginx/{access,error,library-access}.log.1 | grep -E "09/Feb/2019:(07|08|09|10|11)" | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 10

- I know 66.249.66.219 is Google, 5.9.6.51 is MegaIndex, and 5.143.231.38 is SputnikBot
- Ooh, but 151.80.203.180 is some malicious bot making requests for `/etc/passwd` like this:

```
/bitstream/handle/10568/68981/Identifying%20benefit%20flows%20studies%20on%20the%20potential%20monetary%20and%20non%20monetary%20benefits%20arising%20from%20the%20International%20Treaty%20on%20Plant%20Genetic_1671.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=../etc/passwd
```

- 151.80.203.180 is on OVH so I sent a message to their abuse email...

## 2019-02-10

- Linode sent another alert about CGSpace (linode18) CPU load this morning, here are the top IPs in the web server XMLUI and API logs before, during, and after that time:

```
# zcat --force /var/log/nginx/{access,error,library-access}.log /var/log/nginx/{access,error,library-access}.log.1 | grep -E "10/Feb/2019:0(5|6|7|8|9)" | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 10

   4668 205.186.128.185
   4668 70.32.83.92
```

- Another interesting thing might be the total number of requests for web and API services during that time:

```
# zcat --force /var/log/nginx/{access,error,library-access}.log /var/log/nginx/{access,error,library-access}.log.1 | grep -cE "10/Feb/2019:0(5|6|7|8|9)"
16333
# zcat --force /var/log/nginx/{oai,rest,statistics}.log /var/log/nginx/{oai,rest,statistics}.log.1 | grep -cE "10/Feb/2019:0(5|6|7|8|9)"
15964
```

- Also, the number of unique IPs served during that time:

```
# zcat --force /var/log/nginx/{access,error,library-access}.log /var/log/nginx/{access,error,library-access}.log.1 | grep -E "10/Feb/2019:0(5|6|7|8|9)" | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq | wc -l
1622
# zcat --force /var/log/nginx/{oai,rest,statistics}.log /var/log/nginx/{oai,rest,statistics}.log.1 | grep -E "10/Feb/2019:0(5|6|7|8|9)" | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq | wc -l
95
```

- It's very clear to me now that the API requests are the heaviest!
- I think I need to increase the Linode alert threshold from 300 to 350% now so I stop getting some of these alerts—it's becoming a bit of *the boy who cried wolf* because it alerts like clockwork twice per day!
- Add my Python- and shell-based metadata workflow helper scripts as well as the environment settings for pipenv to our DSpace repository ([#408](https://github.com/ilri/DSpace/pull/408)) so I can track changes and distribute them more formally instead of just keeping them [collected on the wiki](https://github.com/ilri/DSpace/wiki/Scripts)
- Started adding IITA research theme (`cg.identifier.iitatheme`) to CGSpace
  - I'm still waiting for feedback from IITA whether they actually want to use "SOCIAL SCIENCE & AGRIC BUSINESS" because it is listed as ["Social Science and Agribusiness"](http://www.iita.org/project-discipline/social-science-and-agribusiness/) on their website
  - Also, I think they want to do some mappings of items with existing subjects to these new themes
- Update ILRI author name style in the controlled vocabulary (Domelevo Entfellner, Jean-Baka) ([#409](https://github.com/ilri/DSpace/pull/409))
  - I'm still waiting to hear from Bizuwork whether we'll batch update all existing items with the old name style
  - No, there is only one entry and Bizu already fixed it
- Last week Hector Tobon from CCAFS asked me about the Creative Commons 3.0 Intergovernmental Organizations (IGO) license because it is not in the list of SPDX licenses
  - Today I made [a request](http://13.57.134.254/app/license_requests/15/) to the [SPDX using their web form](https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to include this class of Creative Commons licenses](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Intergovernmental_Organizations)
- Testing the `mail.server.disabled` property that I noticed in `dspace.cfg` recently
  - Setting it to true results in the following message when I try the `dspace test-email` helper on DSpace Test:

```
Error sending email:
 - Error: cannot test email because mail.server.disabled is set to true
```

- I'm not sure why I didn't know about this configuration option before, and always maintained multiple configurations for development and production
  - I will modify the [Ansible DSpace role](https://github.com/ilri/rmg-ansible-public) to use this in its `build.properties` template
- I updated my local Sonatype nexus Docker image and had an issue with the volume for some reason so I decided to just start from scratch:

```
# docker rm nexus
# docker pull sonatype/nexus3
# mkdir -p /home/aorth/.local/lib/containers/volumes/nexus_data
# chown 200:200 /home/aorth/.local/lib/containers/volumes/nexus_data
# docker run --name nexus --network dspace-build -d -v /home/aorth/.local/lib/containers/volumes/nexus_data:/nexus-data -p 8081:8081 sonatype/nexus3
```

- For some reason my `mvn package` for DSpace is not working now... I might go back to [using Artifactory for caching](https://mjanja.ch/2018/02/cache-maven-artifacts-with-artifactory/) instead:

```
# docker pull docker.bintray.io/jfrog/artifactory-oss:latest
# mkdir -p /home/aorth/.local/lib/containers/volumes/artifactory5_data
# chown 1030 /home/aorth/.local/lib/containers/volumes/artifactory5_data
# docker run --name artifactory --network dspace-build -d -v /home/aorth/.local/lib/containers/volumes/artifactory5_data:/var/opt/jfrog/artifactory -p 8081:8081 docker.bintray.io/jfrog/artifactory-oss
```

## 2019-02-11

- Bosede from IITA said we can use "SOCIAL SCIENCE & AGRIBUSINESS" in their new IITA theme field to be consistent with other places they are using it
- Run all system updates on DSpace Test (linode19) and reboot it

## 2019-02-12

- I notice that [DSpace 6 has included a new JAR-based PDF thumbnailer based on PDFBox](https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-3052), I wonder how good its thumbnails are and how it handles CMYK PDFs
- On a similar note, I wonder if we could use the performance-focused [libvps](https://libvips.github.io/libvips/) and the third-party [jlibvips Java library](https://github.com/codecitizen/jlibvips/) in DSpace
- Testing the `vipsthumbnail` command line tool with [this CGSpace item that uses CMYK](https://cgspace.cgiar.org/handle/10568/51999):

```
$ vipsthumbnail alc_contrastes_desafios.pdf -s 300 -o '%s.jpg[Q=92,optimize_coding,strip]'
```

- (DSpace 5 appears to use JPEG 92 quality so I do the same)
- Thinking about making "top items" endpoints in my [dspace-statistics-api](https://github.com/ilri/dspace-statistics-api)
- I could use the following SQL queries very easily to get the top items by views or downloads:

```
dspacestatistics=# SELECT * FROM items WHERE views > 0 ORDER BY views DESC LIMIT 10;
dspacestatistics=# SELECT * FROM items WHERE downloads > 0 ORDER BY downloads DESC LIMIT 10;
```

- I'd have to think about what to make the REST API endpoints, perhaps: `/statistics/top/items?limit=10`
- But how do I do top items by views / downloads separately?
- I re-deployed DSpace 6.3 locally to test the PDFBox thumbnails, especially to see if they handle CMYK files properly
  - The quality is JPEG 75 and I don't see a way to set the thumbnail dimensions, but the resulting image is indeed sRGB:

```
$ identify -verbose alc_contrastes_desafios.pdf.jpg
...
  Colorspace: sRGB
```

- I will read the PDFBox thumbnailer documentation to see if I can change the size and quality

## 2019-02-13

- ILRI ICT reset the password for the CGSpace mail account, but I still can't get it to send mail from DSpace's `test-email` utility
- I even added extra mail properties to `dspace.cfg` as suggested by someone on the dspace-tech mailing list:

```
mail.extraproperties = mail.smtp.starttls.required = true, mail.smtp.auth=true
```

- But the result is still:

```
Error sending email:
 - Error: com.sun.mail.smtp.SMTPSendFailedException: 530 5.7.57 SMTP; Client was not authenticated to send anonymous mail during MAIL FROM [AM6PR06CA0001.eurprd06.prod.outlook.com]
```

- I tried to log into the Outlook 365 web mail and it doesn't work so I've emailed ILRI ICT again
- After reading the [common mistakes in the JavaMail FAQ](https://javaee.github.io/javamail/FAQ#commonmistakes) I reconfigured the extra properties in DSpace's mail configuration to be simply:

```
mail.extraproperties = mail.smtp.starttls.enable=true
```

- ... and then I was able to send a mail using my personal account where I know the credentials work
- The CGSpace account still gets this error message:

```
Error sending email:
 - Error: javax.mail.AuthenticationFailedException
```

- I updated the [DSpace SMTP settings in `dspace.cfg`](https://github.com/ilri/DSpace/pull/410) as well as the [variables in the DSpace role of the Ansible infrastructure scripts](https://github.com/ilri/rmg-ansible-public/commit/ab5fe4d10e16413cd04ffb1bc3179dc970d6d47c)
- Thierry from CTA is having issues with his account on DSpace Test, and there is no admin password reset function on DSpace (only via email, which is disabled on DSpace Test), so I have to delete and re-create his account:

```
$ dspace user --delete --email blah@cta.int
$ dspace user --add --givenname Thierry --surname Lewyllie --email blah@cta.int --password 'blah'
```

- On this note, I saw a thread on the dspace-tech mailing list that says this functionality exists if you enable `webui.user.assumelogin = true`
- I will enable this on CGSpace ([#411](https://github.com/ilri/DSpace/pull/411))
- Test re-creating my local PostgreSQL and Artifactory containers with podman instead of Docker (using the volumes from my old Docker containers though):

```
# podman pull postgres:9.6-alpine
# podman run --name dspacedb -v /home/aorth/.local/lib/containers/volumes/dspacedb_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -p 5432:5432 -d postgres:9.6-alpine
# podman pull docker.bintray.io/jfrog/artifactory-oss
# podman run --name artifactory -d -v /home/aorth/.local/lib/containers/volumes/artifactory5_data:/var/opt/jfrog/artifactory -p 8081:8081 docker.bintray.io/jfrog/artifactory-oss
```

- Totally works... awesome!
- Then I tried with rootless containers by creating the subuid and subgid mappings for aorth:

```
$ sudo touch /etc/subuid /etc/subgid
$ usermod --add-subuids 10000-75535 aorth
$ usermod --add-subgids 10000-75535 aorth
$ sudo sysctl kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=1
$ podman pull postgres:9.6-alpine
$ podman run --name dspacedb -v /home/aorth/.local/lib/containers/volumes/dspacedb_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -p 5432:5432 -d postgres:9.6-alpine
```

- Which totally works, but Podman's rootless support doesn't work with port mappings yet...
- Deploy the Tomcat-7-from-tarball branch on CGSpace (linode18), but first stop the Ubuntu Tomcat 7 and do some basic prep before running the Ansible playbook:

```
# systemctl stop tomcat7
# apt remove tomcat7 tomcat7-admin
# useradd -m -r -s /bin/bash dspace
# mv /usr/share/tomcat7/.m2 /home/dspace
# mv /usr/share/tomcat7/src /home/dspace
# chown -R dspace:dspace /home/dspace
# chown -R dspace:dspace /home/cgspace.cgiar.org
# dpkg -P tomcat7-admin tomcat7-common
```

- After running the playbook CGSpace came back up, but I had an issue with some Solr cores not being loaded (similar to last month) and this was in the Solr log:

```
2019-02-14 18:17:31,304 ERROR org.apache.solr.core.SolrCore @ org.apache.solr.common.SolrException: Error CREATEing SolrCore 'statistics-2018': Unable to create core [statistics-2018] Caused by: Lock obtain timed out: NativeFSLock@/home/cgspace.cgiar.org/solr/statistics-2018/data/index/write.lock
```

- The issue last month was address space, which is now set as `LimitAS=infinity` in `tomcat7.service`...
- I re-ran the Ansible playbook to make sure all configs etc were the, then rebooted the server
- Still the error persists after reboot
- I will try to stop Tomcat and then remove the locks manually:

```
# find /home/cgspace.cgiar.org/solr/ -iname "write.lock" -delete
```

- After restarting Tomcat the usage statistics are back
- Interestingly, many of the locks were from last month, last year, and even 2015! I'm pretty sure that's not supposed to be how locks work...
- Help Sarah Kasyoka finish an item submission that she was having issues with due to the file size
- I increased the nginx upload limit, but she said she was having problems and couldn't really tell me why
- I logged in as her and completed the submission with no problems...

## 2019-02-15

- Tomcat was killed around 3AM by the kernel's OOM killer according to `dmesg`:

```
[Fri Feb 15 03:10:42 2019] Out of memory: Kill process 12027 (java) score 670 or sacrifice child
[Fri Feb 15 03:10:42 2019] Killed process 12027 (java) total-vm:14108048kB, anon-rss:5450284kB, file-rss:0kB, shmem-rss:0kB
[Fri Feb 15 03:10:43 2019] oom_reaper: reaped process 12027 (java), now anon-rss:0kB, file-rss:0kB, shmem-rss:0kB
```

- The `tomcat7` service shows:

```
Feb 15 03:10:44 linode19 systemd[1]: tomcat7.service: Main process exited, code=killed, status=9/KILL
```

- I suspect it was related to the media-filter cron job that runs at 3AM but I don't see anything particular in the log files
- I want to try to normalize the `text_lang` values to make working with metadata easier
- We currently have a bunch of weird values that DSpace uses like `NULL`, `en_US`, and `en` and others that have been entered manually by editors:

```
dspace=# SELECT DISTINCT text_lang, count(*) FROM metadatavalue WHERE resource_type_id=2 GROUP BY text_lang ORDER BY count DESC;
 text_lang |  count
-----------+---------
           | 1069539
 en_US     |  577110
           |  334768
 en        |  133501
 es        |      12
 *         |      11
 es_ES     |       2
 fr        |       2
 spa       |       2
 E.        |       1
 ethnob    |       1
```

- The majority are `NULL`, `en_US`, the blank string, and `en`—the rest are not enough to be significant
- Theoretically this field could help if you wanted to search for Spanish-language fields in the API or something, but even for the English fields there are two different values (and those are from DSpace itself)!
- I'm going to normalized these to `NULL` at least on DSpace Test for now:

```
dspace=# UPDATE metadatavalue SET text_lang = NULL WHERE resource_type_id=2 AND text_lang IS NOT NULL;
UPDATE 1045410
```

- I started proofing IITA's 2019-01 records that Sisay uploaded this week
  - There were 259 records in IITA's original spreadsheet, but there are 276 in Sisay's collection
  - Also, I found that there are at least twenty duplicates in these records that we will need to address
- ILRI ICT fixed the password for the CGSpace support email account and I tested it on Outlook 365 web and DSpace and it works
- Re-create my local PostgreSQL container to for new PostgreSQL version and to use podman's volumes:

```
$ podman pull postgres:9.6-alpine
$ podman volume create dspacedb_data
$ podman run --name dspacedb -v dspacedb_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -p 5432:5432 -d postgres:9.6-alpine
$ createuser -h localhost -U postgres --pwprompt dspacetest
$ createdb -h localhost -U postgres -O dspacetest --encoding=UNICODE dspacetest
$ psql -h localhost -U postgres dspacetest -c 'alter user dspacetest superuser;'
$ pg_restore -h localhost -U postgres -d dspacetest -O --role=dspacetest -h localhost dspace_2019-02-11.backup
$ psql -h localhost -U postgres -f ~/src/git/DSpace/dspace/etc/postgres/update-sequences.sql dspacetest
$ psql -h localhost -U postgres dspacetest -c 'alter user dspacetest nosuperuser;'
```

- And it's all running without root!
- Then re-create my Artifactory container as well, taking into account ulimit open file requirements by Artifactory as well as the user limitations caused by rootless subuid mappings:

```
$ podman volume create artifactory_data
artifactory_data
$ podman create --ulimit nofile=32000:32000 --name artifactory -v artifactory_data:/var/opt/jfrog/artifactory -p 8081:8081 docker.bintray.io/jfrog/artifactory-oss
$ buildah unshare
$ chown -R 1030:1030 ~/.local/share/containers/storage/volumes/artifactory_data
$ exit
$ podman start artifactory
```

- More on the [subuid permissions issue with rootless containers here](https://podman.io/blogs/2018/10/03/podman-remove-content-homedir.html)

## 2019-02-17

- I ran DSpace's cleanup task on CGSpace (linode18) and there were errors:

```
$ dspace cleanup -v
Error: ERROR: update or delete on table "bitstream" violates foreign key constraint "bundle_primary_bitstream_id_fkey" on table "bundle"
  Detail: Key (bitstream_id)=(162844) is still referenced from table "bundle".
```

- The solution is, as always:
```
$ psql dspace -c 'update bundle set primary_bitstream_id=NULL where primary_bitstream_id in (162844);'
UPDATE 1
```

- I merged the Atmire Metadata Quality Module (MQM) changes to the `5_x-prod` branch and deployed it on CGSpace ([#407](https://github.com/ilri/DSpace/pull/407))
- Then I ran all system updates on CGSpace server and rebooted it

## 2019-02-18

- Jesus fucking Christ, Linode sent an alert that CGSpace (linode18) was using 421% CPU for a few hours this afternoon (server time):
- There seems to have been a lot of activity in XMLUI:

- 94.71.244.172 is in Greece and uses the user agent "Indy Library"
- At least they are re-using their Tomcat session:

```
$ grep -o -E 'session_id=[A-Z0-9]{32}:ip_addr=94.71.244.172' dspace.log.2019-02-18 | sort | uniq | wc -l
```

- The following IPs were all hitting the server hard simultaneously and are located on Amazon and use the user agent "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:45.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/45.0":
  - 52.54.252.47

  - 3.83.14.11
  - 54.164.83.99
  - 18.212.208.240

- Actually, even up to the top 30 IPs are almost all on Amazon and use the same user agent!
- For reference most of these IPs hitting the XMLUI this afternoon are on Amazon:

# zcat --force /var/log/nginx/{access,error,library-access}.log /var/log/nginx/{access,error,library-access}.log.1 | grep -E "18/Feb/2019:1(2|3|4|5|6)" | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 30
   1173 52.91.249.23
   1176 107.22.118.106
   1178 3.88.173.152
   1179 3.81.136.184

   1477 5.9.6.51
   1861 94.71.244.172
```

- In the case of 52.54.252.47 they are only making about 10 requests per minute during this time (albeit from dozens of concurrent IPs):

```
# zcat --force /var/log/nginx/*.log /var/log/nginx/*.log.1 | grep 52.54.252.47 | grep -o -E '18/Feb/2019:1[0-9]:[0-9][0-9]' | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 10
     10 18/Feb/2019:17:20
     10 18/Feb/2019:17:22
     10 18/Feb/2019:17:31
     11 18/Feb/2019:13:21
     11 18/Feb/2019:15:18
     11 18/Feb/2019:16:43
     11 18/Feb/2019:16:57
     11 18/Feb/2019:16:58
     11 18/Feb/2019:18:34
     12 18/Feb/2019:14:37
```

- As this user agent is not recognized as a bot by DSpace this will definitely fuck up the usage statistics
- There were 92,000 requests from these IPs alone today!

```
# zcat --force /var/log/nginx/{access,error,library-access}.log /var/log/nginx/{access,error,library-access}.log.1 | grep -c 'Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:45.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/45.0'
92756
```

- I will add this user agent to the ["badbots" rate limiting in our nginx configuration](https://github.com/ilri/rmg-ansible-public/blob/master/roles/dspace/templates/nginx/default.conf.j2)
- I realized that I had effectively only been applying the "badbots" rate limiting to requests at the root, so I added it to the other blocks that match Discovery, Browse, etc as well
- IWMI sent a few new ORCID identifiers for us to add to our controlled vocabulary
- I will merge them with our existing list and then resolve their names using my `resolve-orcids.py` script:

```
$ cat ~/src/git/DSpace/dspace/config/controlled-vocabularies/cg-creator-id.xml 2019-02-18-IWMI-ORCID-IDs.txt  | grep -oE '[A-Z0-9]{4}-[A-Z0-9]{4}-[A-Z0-9]{4}-[A-Z0-9]{4}' | sort | uniq > /tmp/2019-02-18-combined-orcids.txt
$ ./resolve-orcids.py -i /tmp/2019-02-18-combined-orcids.txt -o /tmp/2019-02-18-combined-names.txt -d
# sort names, copy to cg-creator-id.xml, add XML formatting, and then format with tidy (preserving accents)
$ tidy -xml -utf8 -iq -m -w 0 dspace/config/controlled-vocabularies/cg-creator-id.xml
```

- I merged the changes to the `5_x-prod` branch and they will go live the next time we re-deploy CGSpace ([#412](https://github.com/ilri/DSpace/pull/412))
