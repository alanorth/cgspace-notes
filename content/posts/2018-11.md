## 2018-11-01

- Finalize AReS Phase I and Phase II ToRs
- Send a note about my [dspace-statistics-api](https://github.com/ilri/dspace-statistics-api) to the dspace-tech mailing list

## 2018-11-03

- Linode has been sending mails a few times a day recently that CGSpace (linode18) has had high CPU usage
- Today these are the top 10 IPs:

```
# zcat --force /var/log/nginx/*.log /var/log/nginx/*.log.1 | grep -E "03/Nov/2018" | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 10
   1300 66.249.64.63
   1384 35.237.175.180
   1430 138.201.52.218
   1455 207.46.13.156
   1500 40.77.167.175
   1979 50.116.102.77
   2790 66.249.64.61
   3367 84.38.130.177
   4537 70.32.83.92
  22508 66.249.64.59
```

- The `66.249.64.x` are definitely Google
- `70.32.83.92` is well known, probably CCAFS or something, as it's only a few thousand requests and always to REST API
- `84.38.130.177` is some new IP in Latvia that is only hitting the XMLUI, using the following user agent:

```
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1) AppleWebKit/535.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/14.0.792.0 Safari/535.1
```

- They at least seem to be re-using their Tomcat sessions:

```
$ grep -c -E 'session_id=[A-Z0-9]{32}:ip_addr=84.38.130.177' dspace.log.2018-11-03 | sort | uniq
342
```

- `50.116.102.77` is also a regular REST API user
- `40.77.167.175` and `207.46.13.156` seem to be Bing
- `138.201.52.218` seems to be on Hetzner in Germany, but is using this user agent:

```
Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.12; rv:62.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/62.0
```

- And it doesn't seem they are re-using their Tomcat sessions:

```
$ grep -c -E 'session_id=[A-Z0-9]{32}:ip_addr=138.201.52.218' dspace.log.2018-11-03 | sort | uniq
1243
```

- Ah, we've apparently seen this server exactly a year ago in 2017-11, making 40,000 requests in one day...
- I wonder if it's worth adding them to the list of bots in the nginx config?
- Linode sent a mail that CGSpace (linode18) is using high outgoing bandwidth
- Looking at the nginx logs again I see the following top ten IPs:

```
# zcat --force /var/log/nginx/*.log /var/log/nginx/*.log.1 | grep -E "03/Nov/2018" | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 10
   1979 50.116.102.77
   1980 35.237.175.180
   2186 207.46.13.156
   2208 40.77.167.175
   2843 66.249.64.63
   4220 84.38.130.177
   4537 70.32.83.92
   5593 66.249.64.61
  12557 78.46.89.18
  32152 66.249.64.59
```

- `78.46.89.18` is new since I last checked a few hours ago, and it's from Hetzner with the following user agent:

```
Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.12; rv:62.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/62.0
```

- It's making lots of requests and using quite a number of Tomcat sessions:

```
$ grep -c -E 'session_id=[A-Z0-9]{32}:ip_addr=78.46.89.18' /home/cgspace.cgiar.org/log/dspace.log.2018-11-03 | sort | uniq
8449
```

- I could add this IP to the list of bot IPs in nginx, but it seems like a futile effort when some new IP could come along and do the same thing
- Perhaps I should think about adding rate limits to dynamic pages like `/discover` and `/browse`
- I think it's reasonable for a human to click one of those links five or ten times a minute...
- To contrast, `78.46.89.18` made about 300 requests per minute for a few hours today:

```
# grep 78.46.89.18 /var/log/nginx/access.log | grep -o -E '03/Nov/2018:[0-9][0-9]:[0-9][0-9]' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 20
    286 03/Nov/2018:18:02
    287 03/Nov/2018:18:21
    289 03/Nov/2018:18:23
    291 03/Nov/2018:18:27
    293 03/Nov/2018:18:34
    300 03/Nov/2018:17:58
    300 03/Nov/2018:18:22
    300 03/Nov/2018:18:32
    304 03/Nov/2018:18:12
    305 03/Nov/2018:18:13
    305 03/Nov/2018:18:24
    312 03/Nov/2018:18:39
    322 03/Nov/2018:18:17
    326 03/Nov/2018:18:38
    327 03/Nov/2018:18:16
    330 03/Nov/2018:17:57
    332 03/Nov/2018:18:19
    336 03/Nov/2018:17:56
    340 03/Nov/2018:18:14
    341 03/Nov/2018:18:18
```

- If they want to download all our metadata and PDFs they should use an API rather than scraping the XMLUI
- I will add them to the list of bot IPs in nginx for now and think about enforcing rate limits in XMLUI later
- Also, this is the third (?) time a mysterious IP on Hetzner has done this... who is this?

## 2018-11-04

- Forward Peter's information about CGSpace financials to Modi from ICRISAT
- Linode emailed about the CPU load and outgoing bandwidth on CGSpace (linode18) again
- Here are the top ten IPs active so far this morning:

```
# zcat --force /var/log/nginx/*.log /var/log/nginx/*.log.1 | grep -E "04/Nov/2018" | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 10
   1083 2a03:2880:11ff:2::face:b00c
   1105 2a03:2880:11ff:d::face:b00c
   1111 2a03:2880:11ff:f::face:b00c
   1134 84.38.130.177
   1893 50.116.102.77
   2040 66.249.64.63
   4210 66.249.64.61
   4534 70.32.83.92
  13036 78.46.89.18
  20407 66.249.64.59
```

- `78.46.89.18` is back... and still making tons of Tomcat sessions:

```
$ grep -c -E 'session_id=[A-Z0-9]{32}:ip_addr=78.46.89.18' dspace.log.2018-11-04 | sort | uniq
8765
```

- Also, now we have a ton of Facebook crawlers:

```
# zcat --force /var/log/nginx/*.log /var/log/nginx/*.log.1 | grep -E "04/Nov/2018" | grep "2a03:2880:11ff:" | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n
    905 2a03:2880:11ff:b::face:b00c
    955 2a03:2880:11ff:5::face:b00c
    965 2a03:2880:11ff:e::face:b00c
    984 2a03:2880:11ff:8::face:b00c
    993 2a03:2880:11ff:3::face:b00c
    994 2a03:2880:11ff:7::face:b00c
   1006 2a03:2880:11ff:10::face:b00c
   1011 2a03:2880:11ff:4::face:b00c
   1023 2a03:2880:11ff:6::face:b00c
   1026 2a03:2880:11ff:9::face:b00c
   1039 2a03:2880:11ff:1::face:b00c
   1043 2a03:2880:11ff:c::face:b00c
   1070 2a03:2880:11ff::face:b00c
   1075 2a03:2880:11ff:a::face:b00c
   1093 2a03:2880:11ff:2::face:b00c
   1107 2a03:2880:11ff:d::face:b00c
   1116 2a03:2880:11ff:f::face:b00c
```

- They are really making shit tons of Tomcat sessions:

```
$ grep -c -E 'session_id=[A-Z0-9]{32}:ip_addr=2a03:2880:11ff' dspace.log.2018-11-04 | sort | uniq
14368
```

- Their user agent is:

```
facebookexternalhit/1.1 (+http://www.facebook.com/externalhit_uatext.php)
```

- I will add it to the Tomcat Crawler Session Manager valve
- Later in the evening... ok, this Facebook bot is getting super annoying:

```
# zcat --force /var/log/nginx/*.log /var/log/nginx/*.log.1 | grep -E "04/Nov/2018" | grep "2a03:2880:11ff:" | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n
   1871 2a03:2880:11ff:3::face:b00c
   1885 2a03:2880:11ff:b::face:b00c
   1941 2a03:2880:11ff:8::face:b00c
   1942 2a03:2880:11ff:e::face:b00c
   1987 2a03:2880:11ff:1::face:b00c
   2023 2a03:2880:11ff:2::face:b00c
   2027 2a03:2880:11ff:4::face:b00c
   2032 2a03:2880:11ff:9::face:b00c
   2034 2a03:2880:11ff:10::face:b00c
   2050 2a03:2880:11ff:5::face:b00c
   2061 2a03:2880:11ff:c::face:b00c
   2076 2a03:2880:11ff:6::face:b00c
   2093 2a03:2880:11ff:7::face:b00c
   2107 2a03:2880:11ff::face:b00c
   2118 2a03:2880:11ff:d::face:b00c
   2164 2a03:2880:11ff:a::face:b00c
   2178 2a03:2880:11ff:f::face:b00c
```

- And still making shit tons of Tomcat sessions:

```
$ grep -c -E 'session_id=[A-Z0-9]{32}:ip_addr=2a03:2880:11ff' dspace.log.2018-11-04 | sort | uniq
28470
```

- And that's even using the Tomcat Crawler Session Manager valve!
- Maybe we need to limit more dynamic pages, like the "most popular" country, item, and author pages
- It seems these are popular too, and there is no fucking way Facebook needs that information, yet they are requesting thousands of them!

```
# grep 'face:b00c' /var/log/nginx/access.log /var/log/nginx/access.log.1 | grep -c 'most-popular/'
7033
```

- I added the "most-popular" pages to the list that return `X-Robots-Tag: none` to try to inform bots not to index or follow those pages
- Also, I implemented an nginx rate limit of twelve requests per minute on all dynamic pages... I figure a human user might legitimately request one every five seconds

## 2018-11-05

- I wrote a small Python script [add-dc-rights.py](https://gist.github.com/alanorth/4ff81d5f65613814a66cb6f84fdf1fc5) to add usage rights (`dc.rights`) to CGSpace items based on the CSV Hector gave me from MARLO:

```
$ ./add-dc-rights.py -i /tmp/marlo.csv -db dspace -u dspace -p 'fuuu'
```

- The file `marlo.csv` was cleaned up and formatted in Open Refine
- 165 of the items in their 2017 data are from CGSpace!
- I will add the data to CGSpace this week (done!)
- Jesus, is Facebook *trying* to be annoying?

```
# zcat --force /var/log/nginx/*.log /var/log/nginx/*.log.1 | grep -E "05/Nov/2018" | grep -c "2a03:2880:11ff:"
29889
# grep -c -E 'session_id=[A-Z0-9]{32}:ip_addr=2a03:2880:11ff' dspace.log.2018-11-05 | sort | uniq
29156
# zcat --force /var/log/nginx/*.log /var/log/nginx/*.log.1 | grep -E "05/Nov/2018" | grep "2a03:2880:11ff:" | grep -c -E "(handle|bitstream)"
29896
```

- 29,000 requests from Facebook, 29,000 Tomcat sessions, and none of the requests are to the dynamic pages I rate limited yesterday!

## 2018-11-06

- I updated all the [DSpace helper Python scripts](https://github.com/ilri/DSpace/wiki/Scripts) to validate against PEP 8 using Flake8
- While I was updating the [rest-find-collections.py](https://gist.github.com/alanorth/ddd7f555f0e487fe0e9d3eb4ff26ce50) script I noticed it was using `expand=all` to get the collection and community IDs
- I realized I actually only need `expand=collections,subCommunities`, and I wanted to see how much overhead the extra expands created so I did three runs of each:

```
$ time ./rest-find-collections.py 10568/27629 --rest-url https://dspacetest.cgiar.org/rest
```

- Average time with all expands was 14.3 seconds, and 12.8 seconds with `collections,subCommunities`, so **1.5 seconds difference**!

## 2018-11-07

- Update my [dspace-statistics-api](https://github.com/ilri/dspace-statistics-api) to use a database management class with Python contexts so that connections and cursors are automatically opened and closed
- Tag version 0.7.0 of the dspace-statistics-api

## 2018-11-08

- I deployed verison 0.7.0 of the dspace-statistics-api on DSpace Test (linode19) so I can test it for a few days (and check the Munin stats to see the change in database connections) before deploying on CGSpace
- I also enabled systemd's persistent journal by setting [`Storage=persistent` in *journald.conf*](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/journald.conf.html)
- Apparently [Ubuntu 16.04 defaulted to using rsyslog for boot records until early 2018](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/journald.conf.html), so I removed `rsyslog` too
- Proof 277 IITA records on DSpace Test: [IITA_ ALIZZY1802-csv_oct23](https://dspacetest.cgiar.org/handle/10568/107871)
  - There were a few issues with countries, a few language erorrs, a few whitespace errors, and then a handful of ISSNs in the ISBN field

## 2018-11-11

- I added tests to the [dspace-statistics-api](https://github.com/ilri/dspace-statistics-api)!
- It runs with Python 3.5, 3.6, and 3.7 using pytest, including automatically on Travis CI!

## 2018-11-13

- Help troubleshoot an issue with Judy Kimani submitting to the *ILRI project reports, papers and documents* collection on CGSpace
- For some reason there is an existing group for the "Accept/Reject" workflow step, but it's empty
- I added Judy to the group and told her to try again
- Sisay changed his leave to be full days until December so I need to finish the IITA records that he was working on ([IITA_ ALIZZY1802-csv_oct23](https://dspacetest.cgiar.org/handle/10568/107871)
- Sisay had said there were a few PDFs missing and Bosede sent them this week, so I had to find those items on DSpace Test and add the bitstreams to the items manually
- As for the collection mappings I think I need to export the CSV from DSpace Test, add mappings for each type (ie Books go to IITA books collection, etc), then re-import to DSpace Test, then export from DSpace command line in "migrate" mode...
- From there I should be able to script the removal of the old DSpace Test collection so they just go to the correct IITA collections on import into CGSpace

## 2018-11-14

- Finally import the 277 IITA (ALIZZY1802) records to CGSpace
- I had to export them from DSpace Test and import them into a temporary collection on CGSpace first, then export the collection as CSV to map them to new owning collections (IITA books, IITA posters, etc) with OpenRefine because DSpace's `dspace export` command doesn't include the collections for the items!
- Delete all old IITA collections on DSpace Test and run `dspace cleanup` to get rid of all the bitstreams

## 2018-11-15

- Deploy version 0.8.1 of the [dspace-statistics-api](https://github.com/ilri/dspace-statistics-api) to CGSpace (linode18)

## 2018-11-18

- Request invoice from Wild Jordan for their meeting venue in January
