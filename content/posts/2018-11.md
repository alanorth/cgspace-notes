## 2018-11-03

- Linode has been sending mails a few times a day recently that CGSpace (linode18) has had high CPU usage
- Today these are the top 10 IPs:

```
# zcat --force /var/log/nginx/*.log /var/log/nginx/*.log.1 | grep -E "03/Nov/2018" | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 10
   1300 66.249.64.63
   1384 35.237.175.180
   1430 138.201.52.218
   1455 207.46.13.156
   1500 40.77.167.175
   1979 50.116.102.77
   2790 66.249.64.61
   3367 84.38.130.177
   4537 70.32.83.92
  22508 66.249.64.59
```

- The `66.249.64.x` are definitely Google
- `70.32.83.92` is well known, probably CCAFS or something, as it's only a few thousand requests and always to REST API
- `84.38.130.177` is some new IP in Latvia that is only hitting the XMLUI, using the following user agent:

```
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1) AppleWebKit/535.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/14.0.792.0 Safari/535.1
```

- They at least seem to be re-using their Tomcat sessions:

```
$ grep -c -E 'session_id=[A-Z0-9]{32}:ip_addr=84.38.130.177' dspace.log.2018-11-03 | sort | uniq
342
```

- `50.116.102.77` is also a regular REST API user
- `40.77.167.175` and `207.46.13.156` seem to be Bing
- `138.201.52.218` seems to be on Hetzner in Germany, but is using this user agent:

```
Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.12; rv:62.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/62.0
```

- And it doesn't seem they are re-using their Tomcat sessions:

```
$ grep -c -E 'session_id=[A-Z0-9]{32}:ip_addr=138.201.52.218' dspace.log.2018-11-03 | sort | uniq
1243
```

- Ah, we've apparently seen this server exactly a year ago in 2017-11, making 40,000 requests in one day...
- I wonder if it's worth adding them to the list of bots in the nginx config?
