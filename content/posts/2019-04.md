## 2019-04-01

- Meeting with AgroKnow to discuss CGSpace, ILRI data, AReS, GARDIAN, etc
  - They asked if we had plans to enable RDF support in CGSpace
- There have been 4,400 more downloads of the CTA Spore publication from those strange Amazon IP addresses today
  - I suspected that some might not be successful, because the stats show less, but today they were all HTTP 200!

```
# cat /var/log/nginx/access.log /var/log/nginx/access.log.1 | grep 'Spore-192-EN-web.pdf' | grep -E '(18.196.196.108|18.195.78.144|18.195.218.6)' | awk '{print $9}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 5
   4432 200
```

- In the last two weeks there have been 47,000 downloads of this *same exact PDF* by these three IP addresses
- Apply country and region corrections and deletions on DSpace Test and CGSpace:

```
$ ./fix-metadata-values.py -i /tmp/2019-02-21-fix-9-countries.csv -db dspace -u dspace -p 'fuuu' -f cg.coverage.country -m 228 -t ACTION -d
$ ./fix-metadata-values.py -i /tmp/2019-02-21-fix-4-regions.csv -db dspace -u dspace -p 'fuuu' -f cg.coverage.region -m 231 -t action -d
$ ./delete-metadata-values.py -i /tmp/2019-02-21-delete-2-countries.csv -db dspace -u dspace -p 'fuuu' -m 228 -f cg.coverage.country -d
$ ./delete-metadata-values.py -i /tmp/2019-02-21-delete-1-region.csv -db dspace -u dspace -p 'fuuu' -m 231 -f cg.coverage.region -d
```

- CTA says the Amazon IPs are AWS gateways for real user traffic
- I was trying to add Felix Shaw's account back to the Administrators group on DSpace Test, but I couldn't find his name in the user search of the groups page
  - If I searched for "Felix" or "Shaw" I saw other matches, included one for his personal email address!
  - I ended up finding him via searching for his email address

- Maria from Bioversity emailed me a list of new ORCID identifiers for their researchers so I will add them to our controlled vocabulary
  - First I need to extract the ones that are unique from their list compared to our existing one:

```
$ cat dspace/config/controlled-vocabularies/cg-creator-id.xml /tmp/bioversity.txt | grep -oE '[A-Z0-9]{4}-[A-Z0-9]{4}-[A-Z0-9]{4}-[A-Z0-9]{4}' | sort | uniq > /tmp/2019-04-03-orcid-ids.txt
```

- We currently have 1177 unique ORCID identifiers, and this brings our total to 1237!
- Next I will resolve all their names using my `resolve-orcids.py` script:

```
$ ./resolve-orcids.py -i /tmp/2019-04-03-orcid-ids.txt -o 2019-04-03-orcid-ids.txt -d
```
