- I did G1GC tests on DSpace Test (linode26) to compliment the CMS tests I did yesterday
  - The Discovery indexing took this long:

```console
real    334m33.625s
user    227m51.331s
sys     3m43.037s
```

- Start a full harvest on AReS
- Help Marianne with submit/approve access on a new collection on CGSpace
- Go back in Gaia's batch reports to find records that she indicated for replacing on CGSpace (ie, those with better new copies, new versions, etc)
