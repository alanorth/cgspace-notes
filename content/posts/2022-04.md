- I did G1GC tests on DSpace Test (linode26) to compliment the CMS tests I did yesterday
  - The Discovery indexing took this long:

```console
real    334m33.625s
user    227m51.331s
sys     3m43.037s
```

- Start a full harvest on AReS
- Help Marianne with submit/approve access on a new collection on CGSpace
- Go back in Gaia's batch reports to find records that she indicated for replacing on CGSpace (ie, those with better new copies, new versions, etc)
- Looking at the Solr statistics for 2022-03 on CGSpace
  - I see 54.229.218.204 on Amazon AWS made 49,000 requests, some of which with this user agent: `Apache-HttpClient/4.5.9 (Java/1.8.0_322)`, and many others with a normal browser agent, so that's fishy!
  - The DSpace agent pattern `http.?agent` seems to have caught the first ones, but I'll purge the IP ones
  - I see 40.77.167.80 is Bing or MSN Bot, but using a normal browser user agent, and if I search Solr for `dns:*msnbot* AND dns:*.msn.com.` I see over 100,000, which is a problem I noticed a few months ago too...
  - I extracted the MSN Bot IPs from Solr using an IP facet, then used the `check-spider-ip-hits.sh` script to purge them
