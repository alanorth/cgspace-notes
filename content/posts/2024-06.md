## 2024-06-03

- Working on IFPRI datasets
  - I noticed the licenses were missing from Nilam's original file so I found a way to check [Dataverse's API for a persistent identifier](https://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/api/native-api.html#export-metadata-of-a-dataset-in-various-formats)
  - We have both Handles and DOIs for these datasets, both from Harvard's Dataverse

<!--more-->

- I used this GREL in OpenRefine to create a new column based on URLs using the DOI (uppercasing the DOI for Dataverse):

```
"https://dataverse.harvard.edu/api/datasets/export?exporter=dataverse_json&persistentId=doi:" + value.split('https://doi.org/')[-1].toUppercase()
```

- Then I was able to extract the license text from the JSON response using:

```
value.parseJson()['datasetVersion']['termsOfUse']
```

- Similar for the Handle...
