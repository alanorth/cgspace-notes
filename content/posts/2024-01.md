## 2024-01-02

- Work on preparation of new server for DSpace 7 migration
  - I'm not quite sure what we need to do for the Handle server
  - For now I just ran the `dspace make-handle-config` script and diffed it with the one from DSpace 6
  - I sent the bundle to the Handle admins to make sure it's OK before we do the migration
- Continue testing and debugging the cgspace-java-helpers on DSpace 7
- Work on IFPRI ISNAR archive cleanup

- I haven't heard from the Handle admins so I'm preparing a backup solution using nginx streams
- This seems to work in my simple tests (this must be outside the `http {}` block):

```
stream {
    upstream handle_tcp_9000 {
       server 188.34.177.10:9000;
    }

    server {
        listen 9000;
        proxy_connect_timeout 1s;
        proxy_timeout 3s;
        proxy_pass handle_tcp_9000;
    }
}
```

- Here I forwarded a test TCP port 9000 from one server to another and was able to retrieve a test HTML that was running on the target
  - I will have to do TCP and UDP on port 2641, and TCP/HTTP on port 8000.
- I did some more minor work on the IFPRI ISNAR archive
  - I got some PDFs from the UMN AgEcon search and fixed some metadata
  - Then I did some duplicate checking and found five items already on CGSpace

## 2024-01-04

- Upload 692 items for the ISNAR archive to CGSpace: https://cgspace.cgiar.org/handle/10568/136192
- Help Peter proof and upload 252 items from the 2023 Gender conference to CGSpace
- Meeting with IFPRI to discuss their migration to CGSpace
  - We agreed to add two new fields, one for IFPRI project and one for IFPRI publication ranking
  - Most likely we will use `cg.identifier.project` as a general field and consolidate other project fields there
  - Not sure which field to use for the publication rank...

## 2024-01-05

- Proof and upload 51 items in bulk for IFPRI
