## 2023-03-01

- Remove `cg.subject.wle` and `cg.identifier.wletheme` from CGSpace input form after confirming with IWMI colleagues that they no longer need them (WLE closed in 2021)
- [iso-codes 4.13.0 was released](https://salsa.debian.org/iso-codes-team/iso-codes/-/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#4130-2023-02-28), which incorporates my changes to the common names for Iran, Laos, and Syria
- I finally got through with porting the input form from DSpace 6 to DSpace 7

<!--more-->

- I can't put my finger on it, but the input form has to be formatted very particularly, for example if your rows have more than two fields in them with out a sufficient Bootstrap grid style, or if you use a `twobox`, etc, the entire form step appears blank

- I did some experiments with the new [Pandas 2.0.0rc0 Apache Arrow support](https://datapythonista.me/blog/pandas-20-and-the-arrow-revolution-part-i)
  - There is a change to the way nulls are handled and it causes my tests for `pd.isna(field)` to fail
  - I think we need consider blanks as null, but I'm not sure
- I made some adjustments to the Discovery sidebar facets on DSpace 6 while I was looking at the DSpace 7 configuration
  - I downgraded CIFOR subject, Humidtropics subject, Drylands subject, ICARDA subject, and Language from DiscoverySearchFilterFacet to DiscoverySearchFilter in `discovery.xml` since we are no longer using them in sidebar facets

- Atmire merged one of my old pull requests into COUNTER-Robots:
  - [COUNTER_Robots_list.json: Add new bots](https://github.com/atmire/COUNTER-Robots/pull/54)
- I will update the local ILRI overrides in our DSpace spider agents file

## 2023-03-04

- Submit a [pull request on pycountry to use iso-codes 4.13.0](https://github.com/flyingcircusio/pycountry/pull/156)

- Start a harvest on AReS

## 2023-03-06

- Export CGSpace to do Initiative collection mappings
  - There were thirty-three that needed updating
- Send Abenet and Sam a list of twenty-one CAS publications that had been marked as "multiple documents" that we uploaded as metadata-only items
  - Goshu will download the PDFs for each and upload them to the items on CGSpace manually
- I spent some time trying to get csv-metadata-quality working with the new Arrow backend for Pandas 2.0.0rc0
  - It seems there is a problem recognizing empty strings as na with `pd.isna()`
  - If I do `pd.isna(field) or field == ""` then it works as expected, but that feels hacky
  - I'm going to test again on the next release...
  - Note that I had been setting both of these global options:

```
pd.options.mode.dtype_backend = 'pyarrow'
pd.options.mode.nullable_dtypes = True
```

- Then reading the CSV like this:

```
df = pd.read_csv(args.input_file, engine='pyarrow', dtype='string[pyarrow]'
```
