## 2021-01-03

- Peter notified me that some filters on AReS were broken again
  - It's the same issue with the field names getting `.keyword` appended to the end that I already [filed an issue on OpenRXV about last month](https://github.com/ilri/OpenRXV/issues/66)
  - I fixed the broken filters (careful to not edit any others, lest they break too!)
