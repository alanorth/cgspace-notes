## 2019-01-02

- Linode alerted that CGSpace (linode18) had a higher outbound traffic rate than normal early this morning
- I don't see anything interesting in the web server logs around that time though:

```
# zcat --force /var/log/nginx/*.log /var/log/nginx/*.log.1 | grep -E "02/Jan/2019:0(1|2|3)" | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 10
     92 40.77.167.4
     99 210.7.29.100
    120 38.126.157.45
    177 35.237.175.180
    177 40.77.167.32
    216 66.249.75.219
    225 18.203.76.93
    261 46.101.86.248
    357 207.46.13.1
    903 54.70.40.11
```

- Analyzing the types of requests made by the top few IPs during that time:

```
# zcat --force /var/log/nginx/*.log /var/log/nginx/*.log.1 | grep -E "02/Jan/2019:0(1|2|3)" | grep 54.70.40.11 | grep -o -E "(bitstream|discover|handle)" | sort | uniq -c
     30 bitstream
    534 discover
    352 handle
# zcat --force /var/log/nginx/*.log /var/log/nginx/*.log.1 | grep -E "02/Jan/2019:0(1|2|3)" | grep 207.46.13.1 | grep -o -E "(bitstream|discover|handle)" | sort | uniq -c
    194 bitstream
    345 handle
# zcat --force /var/log/nginx/*.log /var/log/nginx/*.log.1 | grep -E "02/Jan/2019:0(1|2|3)" | grep 46.101.86.248 | grep -o -E "(bitstream|discover|handle)" | sort | uniq -c
    261 handle
```

- It's not clear to me what was causing the outbound traffic spike
- Oh nice! The once-per-year cron job for rotating the Solr statistics actually worked now (for the first time ever!):

```
Moving: 81742 into core statistics-2010
Moving: 1837285 into core statistics-2011
Moving: 3764612 into core statistics-2012
Moving: 4557946 into core statistics-2013
Moving: 5483684 into core statistics-2014
Moving: 2941736 into core statistics-2015
Moving: 5926070 into core statistics-2016
Moving: 10562554 into core statistics-2017
Moving: 18497180 into core statistics-2018
```

- This could by why the outbound traffic rate was high, due to the S3 backup that run at 3:30AM...
