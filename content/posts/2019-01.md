## 2019-01-02

- Linode alerted that CGSpace (linode18) had a higher outbound traffic rate than normal early this morning
- I don't see anything interesting in the web server logs around that time though:

```
# zcat --force /var/log/nginx/*.log /var/log/nginx/*.log.1 | grep -E "02/Jan/2019:0(1|2|3)" | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 10
     92 40.77.167.4
     99 210.7.29.100
    120 38.126.157.45
    177 35.237.175.180
    177 40.77.167.32
    216 66.249.75.219
    225 18.203.76.93
    261 46.101.86.248
    357 207.46.13.1
    903 54.70.40.11
```

- Analyzing the types of requests made by the top few IPs during that time:

```
# zcat --force /var/log/nginx/*.log /var/log/nginx/*.log.1 | grep -E "02/Jan/2019:0(1|2|3)" | grep 54.70.40.11 | grep -o -E "(bitstream|discover|handle)" | sort | uniq -c
     30 bitstream
    534 discover
    352 handle
# zcat --force /var/log/nginx/*.log /var/log/nginx/*.log.1 | grep -E "02/Jan/2019:0(1|2|3)" | grep 207.46.13.1 | grep -o -E "(bitstream|discover|handle)" | sort | uniq -c
    194 bitstream
    345 handle
# zcat --force /var/log/nginx/*.log /var/log/nginx/*.log.1 | grep -E "02/Jan/2019:0(1|2|3)" | grep 46.101.86.248 | grep -o -E "(bitstream|discover|handle)" | sort | uniq -c
    261 handle
```

- It's not clear to me what was causing the outbound traffic spike
