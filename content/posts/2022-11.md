## 2022-11-01

- Last night I re-synced DSpace 7 Test from CGSpace
  - I also updated all my local `7_x-dev` branches on the latest upstreams
- I spent some time updating the authorizations in Alliance collections
  - I want to make sure they use groups instead of individuals where possible!
- I reverted the Cocoon autosave change because it was more of a nuissance that Peter can't upload CSVs from the web interface and is a very low severity security issue

- I ran FixLowQualityThumbnails from cgspace-java-helpers on some large collections on CGSpace and ended up fixing 194 items!
- I did some minor checking and uploaded twenty-four IFPRI outputs for the Initiatives to DSpace Test
- Tim merged my [pull request to override the ImageMagick PDF density in DSpace 7](https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/8553)
  - I ported it to DSpace 6.x and submitted a pull request: https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/8560
