## 2019-03-01

- I checked IITA's 259 Feb 14 records from last month for duplicates using Atmire's Duplicate Checker on a fresh snapshot of CGSpace on my local machine and everything looks good
- I am now only waiting to hear from her about where the items should go, though I assume Journal Articles go to IITA Journal Articles collection, etc...
- Looking at the other half of Udana's WLE records from 2018-11
  - I finished the ones for Restoring Degraded Landscapes (RDL), but these are for Variability, Risks and Competing Uses (VRC)
  - I did the usual cleanups for whitespace, added regions where they made sense for certain countries, cleaned up the DOI link formats, added rights information based on the publications page for a few items
  - Most worryingly, there are encoding errors in the abstracts for eleven items, for example:
  - 68.15% � 9.45 instead of 68.15% ± 9.45
  - 2003�2013 instead of 2003–2013
- I think I will need to ask Udana to re-copy and paste the abstracts with more care using Google Docs

## 2019-03-03

- Trying to finally upload IITA's 259 Feb 14 items to CGSpace so I exported them from DSpace Test:

```
$ mkdir 2019-03-03-IITA-Feb14
$ dspace export -i 10568/108684 -t COLLECTION -m -n 0 -d 2019-03-03-IITA-Feb14
```

- As I was inspecting the archive I noticed that there were some problems with the bitsreams:
  - First, Sisay didn't include the bitstream descriptions
  - Second, only five items had bitstreams and I remember in the discussion with IITA that there should have been nine!
  - I had to refer to the original CSV from January to find the file names, then download and add them to the export contents manually!
- After adding the missing bitstreams and descriptions manually I tested them again locally, then imported them to a temporary collection on CGSpace:

```
$ dspace import -a -c 10568/99832 -e aorth@stfu.com -m 2019-03-03-IITA-Feb14.map -s /tmp/2019-03-03-IITA-Feb14
```

- DSpace's export function doesn't include the collections for some reason, so you need to import them somewhere first, then export the collection metadata and re-map the items to proper owning collections based on their types using OpenRefine or something
- After re-importing to CGSpace to apply the mappings, I deleted the collection on DSpace Test and ran the `dspace cleanup` script
- Merge the IITA research theme changes from last month to the `5_x-prod` branch ([#413](https://github.com/ilri/DSpace/pull/413))
  - I will deploy to CGSpace soon and then think about how to batch tag all IITA's existing items with this metadata
- Deploy Tomcat 7.0.93 on CGSpace (linode18) after having tested it on DSpace Test (linode19) for a week
