## 2019-03-01

- I checked IITA's 259 Feb 14 records from last month for duplicates using Atmire's Duplicate Checker on a fresh snapshot of CGSpace on my local machine and everything looks good
- I am now only waiting to hear from her about where the items should go, though I assume Journal Articles go to IITA Journal Articles collection, etc...
- Looking at the other half of Udana's WLE records from 2018-11
  - I finished the ones for Restoring Degraded Landscapes (RDL), but these are for Variability, Risks and Competing Uses (VRC)
  - I did the usual cleanups for whitespace, added regions where they made sense for certain countries, cleaned up the DOI link formats, added rights information based on the publications page for a few items
  - Most worryingly, there are encoding errors in the abstracts for eleven items, for example:
  - 68.15% � 9.45 instead of 68.15% ± 9.45
  - 2003�2013 instead of 2003–2013
- I think I will need to ask Udana to re-copy and paste the abstracts with more care using Google Docs
