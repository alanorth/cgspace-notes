## 2023-12-01

- There is still high load on CGSpace and I don't know why
  - I don't see a high number of sessions compared to previous days in the last few weeks

<!-- more -->

```console
$ for file in dspace.log.2023-11-[23]*; do echo "$file"; grep -a -oE 'session_id=[A-Z0-9]{32}' "$file" | sort | uniq | wc -l; done

```

- Even the number of unique IPs is not very high compared to the last week or so:

```console
# awk '{print $1}' /var/log/nginx/{access,library-access,oai,rest}.log.1 | sort | uniq | wc -l
17023
# awk '{print $1}' /var/log/nginx/{access,library-access,oai,rest}.log.2.gz | sort | uniq | wc -l
17294
# awk '{print $1}' /var/log/nginx/{access,library-access,oai,rest}.log.3.gz | sort | uniq | wc -l
22057
# awk '{print $1}' /var/log/nginx/{access,library-access,oai,rest}.log.4.gz | sort | uniq | wc -l
32956
# awk '{print $1}' /var/log/nginx/{access,library-access,oai,rest}.log.5.gz | sort | uniq | wc -l
11415
# awk '{print $1}' /var/log/nginx/{access,library-access,oai,rest}.log.6.gz | sort | uniq | wc -l
15444
# awk '{print $1}' /var/log/nginx/{access,library-access,oai,rest}.log.7.gz | sort | uniq | wc -l
12648
```

- It doesn't make any sense so I think I'm going to restart the server...
  - After restarting the server the load went down to normal levels... who knows...
- I started trying to see how I'm going to generate the fake statistics for the Alliance bitstream that was replaced
  - I exported all the statistics for the owningItem now:

```console
$ chrt -b 0 ./run.sh -s http://localhost:8081/solr/statistics -a export -o /tmp/stats-export.json -f 'owningItem:b5862bfa-9799-4167-b1cf-76f0f4ea1e18' -k uid
```

- Importing them into DSpace Test didn't show the statistics in the Atmire module, but I see them in Solr...

## 2023-12-02

- Export CGSpace to check for missing Initiative collection mappings
- Start a harvest on AReS

## 2023-12-04

- Send a message to Altmetric support because the item IWMI highlighted last month still doesn't show the attention score for the Handle after I tweeted it several times weeks ago
- Spent some time writing a Python script to fix the literal MaxMind City JSON objects in our Solr statistics
  - There are about 1.6 million of these, so I exported them using solr-import-export-json with the query `city:com*` but ended up finding many that have missing bundles, container bitstreams, etc:

```
city:com* AND -bundleName:[* TO *] AND -containerBitstream:[* TO *] AND -file_id:[* TO *] AND -owningItem:[* TO *] AND -version_id:[* TO *]
```

- (Note the negation to find fields that are missing)
- I don't know what I want to do with these yet

## 2023-12-05

- I finished the `fix_maxmind_stats.py` script and fixed 1.6 million records and imported them on CGSpace after testing on DSpace 7 Test
- Altmetric said there was a glitch regarding the Handle and DOI linking and they successfully re-scraped the item page and linked them
  - They sent me a list of current production IPs and I notice that some of them are in our nginx bot network list:

```console
$ for network in $(csvcut -c network /tmp/ips.csv | sed 1d | sort -u); do grepcidr $network ~/src/git/rmg-ansible-public/roles/dspace/files/nginx/bot-networks.conf; done
108.128.0.0/13 'bot';
46.137.0.0/16 'bot';
52.208.0.0/13 'bot';
52.48.0.0/13 'bot';
54.194.0.0/15 'bot';
54.216.0.0/14 'bot';
54.220.0.0/15 'bot';
54.228.0.0/15 'bot';
63.32.242.35/32     'bot';
63.32.0.0/14 'bot';
99.80.0.0/15 'bot'
```

- I will remove those for now so that Altmetric doesn't have any unexpected issues harvesting

## 2023-12-08

- Finalized the script to generate Solr statistics for Alliance research Mirjam
  - The script is `ilri/generate_solr_statistics.py`
  - I generated ~3,200 statistics based on her records of the download statistics of [that item](https://hdl.handle.net/10568/131997) and imported them on CGSpace
- Did some work on the DSpace 7 submission form
- Peter asked for lists of affiliations, investors, and publishers to do some cleanups
  - I generated a list from a CSV export instead of doing it based on a SQL dump...

```console
$ csvcut -c 'cg.contributor.affiliation[en_US]' /tmp/initiatives.csv       \
  | sed -e 1d -e 's/^"//' -e 's/"$//' -e 's/||/\n/g' -e '/^$/d'            \
  | sort | uniq -c | sort -hr                                              \
  | awk 'BEGIN { FS = "^[[:space:]]+[[:digit:]]+[[:space:]]+" } {print $2}'\
  | sed -e '1i cg.contributor.affiliation' -e 's/^\(.*\)$/"\1"/'           \
  > /tmp/2023-12-08-initiatives-affiliations.csv
```

- Export a list of authors as well:

```console
localhost/dspace7= â˜˜ \COPY (SELECT DISTINCT text_value AS "dc.contributor.author", count(*) FROM metadatavalue WHERE dspace_object_id in (SELECT dspace_object_id FROM item) AND metadata_field_id = 3 GROUP BY "dc.contributor.author" ORDER BY count DESC) to /tmp/2023-12-08-authors.csv WITH CSV HEADER;
COPY 102435
```

## 2023-12-11

- Work on OpenRXV dependencies and podman a bit
- Peter noticed that the statistics for this month are very very low on CGSpace
  - I don't know what is going on, perhaps it is related to me adjusting the nginx config last week?
  - Ah, it's probably because of the spider patterns I updated on 2023-11

## 2023-12-16

- Export CGSpace to check for missing Initiative collection mappings
- Start a harvest on AReS

## 2023-12-17

- Pull latest master branch for OpenRXV and deploy on the server
  - I threw away some changes in the tree regarding the Angular base ref, and it broke AReS
  - So note to self: we need to set the base ref in `frontend/Dockerfile` before building!
- Now Salem fixed the country map

## 2023-12-18

- Work a bit on the IFPRI-ISNAR archive from Leigh
- More work on the DSpace 7 home page

## 2023-12-19

- More work on the DSpace 7 home page
- The Alliance TIP team is testing deposits to the DSpace 7 REST API and getting an HTTP 500 error
  - In the DSpace logs I see this after they log in, create the item, and update the metadata:

```
2023-12-19 17:49:28,022 ERROR unknown unknown org.dspace.rest.Resource @ Something get wrong. Aborting context in finally statement.
```

- I found some messages on the dspace-tech mailing list suggesting this might be an old bug: https://groups.google.com/g/dspace-tech/c/My1GUFYFGoU/m/tS7-WAJPAwAJ
  - I restarted Tomcat and told the Alliance TIP team to try again

## 2023-12-20

- The Alliance guys said that submitting via REST works now... sigh, so that's just some old DSpace 5/6 REST API bug
- I lowercased all our AGROVOC keywords in `dcterms.subject` in SQL:

```console
dspace=# BEGIN;
BEGIN
dspace=*# UPDATE metadatavalue SET text_value=LOWER(text_value) WHERE dspace_object_id IN (SELECT uuid FROM item) AND metadata_field_id=187 AND text_value ~ '[[:upper:]]';
UPDATE 462
dspace=*# COMMIT;
COMMIT
```
