- There is still high load on CGSpace and I don't know why
  - I don't see a high number of sessions compared to previous days in the last few weeks

<!-- more -->

```console
$ for file in dspace.log.2023-11-[23]*; do echo "$file"; grep -a -oE 'session_id=[A-Z0-9]{32}' "$file" | sort | uniq | wc -l; done

```

- Even the number of unique IPs is not very high compared to the last week or so:

```console
# awk '{print $1}' /var/log/nginx/{access,library-access,oai,rest}.log.1 | sort | uniq | wc -l
17023
# awk '{print $1}' /var/log/nginx/{access,library-access,oai,rest}.log.2.gz | sort | uniq | wc -l
17294
# awk '{print $1}' /var/log/nginx/{access,library-access,oai,rest}.log.3.gz | sort | uniq | wc -l
22057
# awk '{print $1}' /var/log/nginx/{access,library-access,oai,rest}.log.4.gz | sort | uniq | wc -l
32956
# awk '{print $1}' /var/log/nginx/{access,library-access,oai,rest}.log.5.gz | sort | uniq | wc -l
11415
# awk '{print $1}' /var/log/nginx/{access,library-access,oai,rest}.log.6.gz | sort | uniq | wc -l
15444
# awk '{print $1}' /var/log/nginx/{access,library-access,oai,rest}.log.7.gz | sort | uniq | wc -l
12648
```

- It doesn't make any sense so I think I'm going to restart the server...
  - After restarting the server the load went down to normal levels... who knows...
- I started trying to see how I'm going to generate the fake statistics for the Alliance bitstream that was replaced
  - I exported all the statistics for the owningItem now:

```console
$ chrt -b 0 ./run.sh -s http://localhost:8081/solr/statistics -a export -o /tmp/stats-export.json -f 'owningItem:b5862bfa-9799-4167-b1cf-76f0f4ea1e18' -k uid
```

- Importing them into DSpace Test didn't show the statistics in the Atmire module, but I see them in Solr...

- Export CGSpace to check for missing Initiative collection mappings
- Start a harvest on AReS

<!-- vim: set sw=2 ts=2: -->
