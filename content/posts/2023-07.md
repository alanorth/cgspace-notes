## 2023-07-01

- Export CGSpace to check for missing Initiative collection mappings
- Start harvesting on AReS

## 2023-07-02

- Minor edits to the `crossref_doi_lookup.py` script while running some checks from 22,000 CGSpace DOIs

## 2023-07-03

- I analyzed the licenses declared by Crossref and found with high confidence that ~400 of ours were incorrect
  - I took the more accurate ones from Crossref and updated the items on CGSpace
  - I took a few hundred ISBNs as well for where we were missing them
  - I also tagged ~4,700 items with missing licenses as "Copyrighted; all rights reserved" based on their Crossref license status being TDM, mostly from Elsevier, Wiley, and Springer
  - Checking a dozen or so manually, I confirmed that if Crossref only has a TDM license then it's usually copyrighted (could still be open access, but we can't tell via Crossref)
  - I would be curious to write a script to check the Unpaywall API for open access status...
  - In the past I found that their *license* status was not very accurate, but the open access status might be more reliable
- More minor work on the DSpace 7 item views
  - I learned some new Angular template syntax
  - I created a custom component to show Creative Commons licenses on the simple item page
  - I also decided that I don't like the Impact Area icons as a component because they don't have any visual meaning

## 2023-07-04

- Focus group meeting with CGSpace partners about DSpace 7
- I added a themed file selection component to the CGSpace theme
  - It displays the bistream description instead of the file name, just like we did in DSpace 6 XMLUI
- I added a custom component to show share icons
