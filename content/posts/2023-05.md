## 2023-05-03

- Alliance's TIP team emailed me to ask about issues authenticating on CGSpace
  - It seems their password expired, which is annoying
- I continued looking at the CGSpace subjects for the FAO / AGROVOC exercise that I started last week
  - There are many of our subjects that would match if they added a "-" like "high yielding varieties" or used singular...
  - Also I found at least two spelling mistakes, for example "decison support systems", which would match if it was spelled correctly
- Work on cleaning, proofing, and uploading twenty-seven records for IFPRI to CGSpace

<!--more-->

- I notice there are a few dozen locks from the `dspaceWeb` pool that are five days old on CGSpace so I killed them

```console
$ psql < locks-age.sql | grep " days " | awk -F"|" '{print $10}' | sort -u | xargs kill
```

- Sync DSpace Test with CGSpace
- I replaced one item's thumbnail with a WebP version and XMLUI displays it fine
- I spent some time checking the CMYK issue with Arch's ImageMagick 7 and the Docker container and I think ImageMagick 7 just handles CMYK wrong...
  - libvips does it correctly automatically and looks closer to the PDF
- Meeting about CG Core types
