## 2023-08-03

- I finally got around to working on Peter's cleanups for affiliations, authors, and donors from last week
  - I did some minor cleanups myself and applied them to CGSpace
- Start working on some batch uploads for IFPRI

<!--more-->

## 2023-08-04

- Minor cleanups on IFPRI's batch uploads
  - I also did a duplicate check and found thirteen items that seem to be duplicates, so I sent them to Leigh to check
- I read this [interesting blog post about PostgreSQL's `log_statement` function](https://www.endpointdev.com/blog/2012/06/logstatement-postgres-all-full-logging/)
  - Someone pointed out that this also lets you take advantage of [PgBadger](https://github.com/darold/pgbadger) analysis
  - I enabled statement logging on DSpace Test and I will check it in a few days
- Reading about DSpace 7 REST API again
  - Here is how to get the first page of 100 items: https://dspace7test.ilri.org/server/api/discover/search/objects?dsoType=item&page=1&size=100
  - I really want to benchmark this to see how fast we can get all the pages
  - Another thing I notice is that the bitstreams are not here, so that will be an extra call...

- Export CGSpace to check for missing Initiative collection mappings
- Start a harvest on AReS

## 2023-08-07

- I'm checking the PostgreSQL logs now that statement logging has been enabled for a few days on DSpace Test
  - I see the logs are about 7 or 8 GB, which is larger than expectedâ€”and this is the test server!
  - I will now play with pgbadger to see if it gives any useful insights
  - Hmm, it sems the `log_statement` advice was old as pgbadger itself says:

> Do not enable log_statement as its log format will not be parsed by pgBadger.

... and:

> Warning: Do not enable both log_min_duration_statement, log_duration and log_statement all together, this will result in wrong counter values. Note that this will also increase drastically the size of your log. log_min_duration_statement should always be preferred.

- So we need to follow pgbadger's instructions rather to get a suitable log file
  - After enabling the new settings I see that our log file is going to be reaallllly big... hmmmm will check tomorrow morning
- More work on the IFPRI batch uploads
