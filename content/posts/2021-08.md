## 2021-08-01

- Update Docker images on AReS server (linode20) and reboot the server:

```console
# docker images | grep -v ^REPO | sed 's/ \+/:/g' | cut -d: -f1,2 | grep -v none | xargs -L1 docker pull
```

- I decided to upgrade linode20 from Ubuntu 18.04 to 20.04

<!--more-->

- First running all existing updates, taking some backups, checking for broken packages, and then rebooting:

```console
# apt update && apt dist-upgrade
# apt autoremove && apt autoclean
# check for any packages with residual configs we can purge
# dpkg -l | grep -E '^rc' | awk '{print $2}'
# dpkg -l | grep -E '^rc' | awk '{print $2}' | xargs dpkg -P
# dpkg -C
# dpkg -l > 2021-08-01-linode20-dpkg.txt
# tar -I zstd -cvf 2021-08-01-etc.tar.zst /etc
# reboot
# sed -i 's/bionic/focal/' /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*.list
# do-release-upgrade
```
- ... but of course it hit [the libxcrypt bug](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libxcrypt/+bug/1903838)
- I had to get a copy of libcrypt.so.1.1.0 from a working Ubuntu 20.04 system and finish the upgrade manually

```console
# apt install -f
# apt dist-upgrade
# reboot
```

- After rebooting I purged all packages with residual configs and cleaned up again:

```console
# dpkg -l | grep -E '^rc' | awk '{print $2}' | xargs dpkg -P
# apt autoremove && apt autoclean
```

- Then I cleared my local Ansible fact cache and re-ran the [infrastructure playbooks](https://github.com/ilri/rmg-ansible-public)
- Open [an issue for the value mappings global replacement bug in OpenRXV](https://github.com/ilri/OpenRXV/issues/111)
- Advise Peter and Abenet on expected CGSpace budget for 2022
- Start a fresh harvesting on AReS (linode20)

## 2021-08-02

- Help Udana with OAI validation on CGSpace
  - He was checking the OAI base URL on OpenArchives and I had to verify the results in order to proceed to Step 2
  - Now it seems to be verified (all green): https://www.openarchives.org/Register/ValidateSite?log=R23ZWX85
  - We are listed in the OpenArchives list of databases conforming to OAI 2.0
