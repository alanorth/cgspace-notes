## 2024-02-05

- Delete duplicate metadata as described in my DSpace issue from last year: https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/issues/8253
- Lower case all the AGROVOC subjects on CGSpace

<!--more-->

```sql
dspace=# BEGIN;
BEGIN
dspace=*# UPDATE metadatavalue SET text_value=LOWER(text_value) WHERE dspace_object_id IN (SELECT uuid FROM item) AND metadata_field_id=187 AND text_value ~ '[[:upper:]]';
UPDATE 180
dspace=*# COMMIT;
COMMIT
```

- Discuss IWMI using the CGSpace REST API for their new website
- Export the IWMI community to extract their ORCID identifiers:

```console
$ dspace metadata-export -i 10568/16814 -f /tmp/iwmi.csv
$ csvcut -c 'cg.creator.identifier,cg.creator.identifier[en_US]' ~/Downloads/2024-02-06-iwmi.csv \
  | grep -oE '[A-Z0-9]{4}-[A-Z0-9]{4}-[A-Z0-9]{4}-[A-Z0-9]{4}' \
  | sort -u \
  | tee /tmp/iwmi-orcids.txt \
  | wc -l
353
$ ./ilri/resolve_orcids.py -i /tmp/iwmi-orcids.txt -o /tmp/iwmi-orcids-names.csv -d
```

- I noticed some similar looking names in our list so I clustered them in OpenRefine and manually checked a dozen or so to update our list

- Maria asked me about the "missing" item from last week again
  - I can see it when I used the Admin search, but not in her workflow
  - It was submitted by TIP so I checked that user's workspace and found it there
  - After depositing, it went into the workflow so Maria should be able to see it now

## 2024-02-09

- Minor edits to CGSpace submission form
- Upload 55 ISNAR book chapters to CGSpace from Peter

## 2024-02-19

- Looking into the collection mapping issue on CGSpace
  - It seems to be by design in DSpace 7: https://github.com/DSpace/dspace-angular/issues/1203
  - This is a massive setback for us...
