- Look at Bioversity's latest migration CSV and now I see that Francesco has cleaned up the extra columns and the newline at the end of the file, but many of the column headers have an extra space in the name...

- Deploy ORCID identifier updates requested by Bioversity to CGSpace
- Run system updates on CGSpace (linode18) and reboot it
  - Before updating it I checked Solr and verified that all statistics cores were loaded properly...
  - After rebooting, all statistics cores were loaded... wow, that's lucky.
- Run system updates on DSpace Test (linode19) and reboot it
