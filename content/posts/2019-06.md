- Merge the [Solr filterCache](https://github.com/ilri/DSpace/pull/425) and [XMLUI ISI journal](https://github.com/ilri/DSpace/pull/426) changes to the `5_x-prod` branch and deploy on CGSpace
- Run system updates on CGSpace (linode18) and reboot it

## 2019-06-03

- Skype with Marie-Angélique and Abenet about [CG Core v2](https://agriculturalsemantics.github.io/cg-core/cgcore.html)

<!--more-->

- Here is a list of proposed metadata migrations for CGSpace
  - dc.language.iso→DCTERMS.language (and switch to ISO 639-2 Alpha 3)
  - dc.description.abstract→DCTERMS.abstract
  - dc.identifier.citation→DCTERMS.bibliographicCitation
  - dc.contributor.author→DCTERMS.creator (for people)
  - dc.description.sponsorship→cg.contributor.donor (values from CrossRef or Grid.ac if possible)
  - dc.rights→DCTERMS.license
  - cg.identifier.status→DCTERMS.accessRights (values "open" or "restricted")
  - cg.creator.id→cg.creator.identifier?
  - dc.relation.ispartofseries→DCTERMS.isPartOf
  - cg.link.relation→DCTERMS.relation
- Marie agreed that we need to adopt some controlled lists for our values, and pointed out that the MARLO team maintains a list of CRPs and Centers at [CLARISA](https://clarisa.cgiar.org/)
  - There is an API there but it needs a password for access...

## 2019-06-04

- The MARLO team responded and said they will give us access to the CLARISA API
- Marie-Angélique [proposed](https://github.com/AgriculturalSemantics/cg-core/pull/1) to integrate `dcterms.isPartOf`, `dcterms.abstract`, and `dcterms.bibliographicCitation` into the CG Core v2 schema
  - I told her I would attempt to integrate those and the others above into DSpace Test soon and report back
  - We also need to discuss with the ILRI Data Portal, MEL/MELSpace, and users who consume the CGSpace API
- Add Arabic language to input-forms.xml ([#427](https://github.com/ilri/DSpace/pull/427)), as Bioversity is adding some Arabic items and noticed it missing

## 2019-06-05

- Send mail to CGSpace and MELSpace people to let them know about the proposed metadata field migrations after the discussion with Marie-Angélique

## 2019-06-07

- Thierry noticed that the CUA statistics were missing previous years again, and I see that the Solr admin UI has the following message:

```
statistics-2018: org.apache.solr.common.SolrException:org.apache.solr.common.SolrException: Error opening new searcher 
```

- I had to restart Tomcat a few times for all the stats cores to get loaded with no issue
