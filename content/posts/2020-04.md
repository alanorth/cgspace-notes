## 2020-04-02

- Maria asked me to update Charles Staver's ORCID iD in the submission template and on CGSpace, as his name was lower case before, and now he has corrected it
  - I updated the fifty-eight existing items on CGSpace
- Looking into the items Udana had asked about last week that were missing Altmetric donuts:
  - [The first](https://hdl.handle.net/10568/103225) is still missing its DOI, so I added it and [tweeted its handle](https://twitter.com/mralanorth/status/1245632619661766657) (after a few hours there was a donut with score 222)
  - [The second item](https://hdl.handle.net/10568/106899) now has a donut with score 2 since I [tweeted its handle](https://twitter.com/mralanorth/status/1243158045540134913) last week
  - [The third item](https://hdl.handle.net/10568/107258) now has a donut with score 1 since I [tweeted it](https://twitter.com/mralanorth/status/1243158786392625153) last week
- On the same note, the [one item](https://hdl.handle.net/10568/106573) Abenet pointed out last week now has a donut with score of 104 after I [tweeted it](https://twitter.com/mralanorth/status/1243163710241345536) last week

<!--more-->

- Altmetric responded about [one item](https://hdl.handle.net/10568/101286) that had no donut since at least 2019-12 and said they fixed some problems with their bot's user agent
  - I decided to [tweet the item](https://twitter.com/mralanorth/status/1245703049445851140), as I can't remember if I ever did it before
