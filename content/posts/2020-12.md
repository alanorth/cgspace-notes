## 2020-12-01

- Atmire responded about the issue with duplicate data in our Solr statistics
  - They noticed that some records in the statistics-2015 core haven't been migrated with the AtomicStatisticsUpdateCLI tool yet and assumed that I haven't migrated any of the records yet
  - That's strange, as I checked all ten cores and 2015 is the only one with some unmigrated documents, as according to the `cua_version` field
  - I started processing those (about 411,000 records):

```console
$ chrt -b 0 dspace dsrun com.atmire.statistics.util.update.atomic.AtomicStatisticsUpdateCLI -t 12 -c statistics-2015
```

- AReS went down when the `renew-letsencrypt` service stopped the `angular_nginx` container in the pre-update hook and failed to bring it back up
  - I ran all system updates on the host and rebooted it and AReS came back up OK
