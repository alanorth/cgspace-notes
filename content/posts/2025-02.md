## 2025-02-21

- Battling with high load on CGSpace from bots a few times the past few weeks
  - I think I need to re-work the bot filtering some how

<!--more-->

- I extracted all the unique IPs from the past ~45 days:

```console
# zcat -f /var/log/nginx/api-access.log.* | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq > /tmp/ips.txt
# wc -l /tmp/ips.txt
449405 /tmp/ips.txt
```

- It's an impressive 450,000 IPs!
- I will run them through my `resolve_addresses_geoip2.py` script to tease out the large offenders
  - I had to split the file into 100,000 segments to get the script to run!
  - Found some new datacenter networks to add to the list:
    - AS32934 Facebook (I'm surprised this wasn't already there, as I know I've blocked it in the past)
    - AS209366 Semrush, which does user a proper user agent, but they don't respect robots.txt and give us no value
    - AS13150 Datacenter ISP (CATON - CATO NETWORKS LTD, IL)
    - AS20473 AS-VULTR, US
    - AS13335 CLOUDFLARENET, US ... wtf is Cloudflare doing? They made requests from 2,600 IPs in the last month???
