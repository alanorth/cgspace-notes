## 2025-11-12

- A few days ago I noticed some PDFs with size 0 bytes while updating thumbnails with the media filter
  - I mentioned it on DSpace Slack and we realized that an MD5 of a null string is always d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e

<!--more-->

- I see 175 of those in the database:

```sql
# SELECT * FROM bitstream WHERE checksum='d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e';
```

<!-- vim: set sw=2 ts=2: -->
