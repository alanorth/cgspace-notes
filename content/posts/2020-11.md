## 2020-11-01

- Continue with processing the statistics-2019 Solr core with the AtomicStatisticsUpdateCLI tool on DSpace Test
  - So far we've spent at least fifty hours to process the statistics and statistics-2019 core... wow.

<!--more-->

## 2020-11-02

- Talk to Moayad and fix a few issues on OpenRXV:
  - Incorrect views and downloads (caused by Elasticsearch's default result set size of 10)
  - Invalid share link
  - Missing "https://" for Handles in the Simple Excel report (caused by using the `handle` instead of the `uri`)
  - Sorting the list of items by views
- I resumed the processing of the statistics-2018 Solr core after it spent 20 hours to get to 60%

## 2020-11-04

- After 29 hours the statistics-2017 core finished processing so I started the statistics-2016 core on DSpace Test

## 2020-11-05

- Peter sent me corrections and deletions for the author affiliations
  - I quickly proofed them for UTF-8 issues in OpenRefine and csv-metadata-quality and then tested them locally and then applied them on CGSpace:

```
$ ./fix-metadata-values.py -i 2020-11-05-fix-862-affiliations.csv -db dspace -u dspace -p 'fuuu' -f cg.contributor.affiliation -t 'correct' -m 211
$ ./delete-metadata-values.py -i 2020-11-05-delete-29-affiliations.csv -db dspace -u dspace -p 'fuuu' -f cg.contributor.affiliation -m 211
```

- Then I started a Discovery re-index on CGSpace:

```
$ time chrt -b 0 ionice -c2 -n7 nice -n19 dspace index-discovery -b

real    92m24.993s
user    8m11.858s
sys     2m26.931s
```

## 2020-11-06

- Restart the AtomicStatisticsUpdateCLI processing of the statistics-2016 core on DSpace Test after 20 hours...
  - This phase finished after five hours so I started it on the statistics-2015 core

## 2020-11-07

- Atmire responded about the issue with duplicate values in owningComm and containerCommunity etc
  - I told them to please look into it and use some of our credits if need be
- The statistics-2015 core finished after 20 hours so I started the statistics-2014 core

## 2020-11-08

- Add "Data Paper" to types on CGSpace
- Add "SCALING CLIMATE-SMART AGRICULTURE" to CCAFS subjects on CGSpace
- Add "ANDEAN ROOTS AND TUBERS" to CIP subjects on CGSpace
- Add CGIAR System subjects to Discovery sidebar facets on CGSpace
  - Also add the System subject to item view on CGSpace
- The statistics-2014 core finished processing after five hours, so I started processing the statistics-2013 core on DSpace Test
- Since I was going to restart CGSpace and update the Discovery indexes anyways I decided to check for any straggling upper case AGROVOC entries and lower case them:

```
dspace=# BEGIN;
dspace=# UPDATE metadatavalue SET text_value=LOWER(text_value) WHERE resource_type_id=2 AND metadata_field_id=57 AND text_value ~ '[[:upper:]]';
UPDATE 164
dspace=# COMMIT;
```

- Run system updates on CGSpace (linode18) and reboot it
  - I had to restart Tomcat once after the machine started up to get all Solr statistics cores to load properly
- After about ten more hours the rest of the Solr statistics cores finished processing on DSpace Test and I started optimizing them in Solr admin UI

## 2020-11-10

- I am noticing that CGSpace doesn't have any statistics showing for years before 2020, but all cores are loaded successfully in Solr Admin UI... strange
  - I restarted Tomcat and I see in Solr Admin UI that the statistics-2015 core failed to load
  - Looking in the DSpace log I see:

```

```

- Seems that the core gets probed twice... perhaps a threading issue?
  - The only thing I can think of is the `acceptorThreadCount` parameter in Tomcat's server.xml, which has been set to 2 since 2018-01 (we started sharding the Solr statistics cores in 2019-01 and that's when this problem arose)
  - I will try reducing that to 1
  - Wow, now it's even worse:

```

```

- Could it be because we have two Tomcat connectors?
  - I restarted Tomcat a few more times before all cores loaded, and still there are no stats before 2020-01... hmmmmm
- I added a [lowercase formatter to OpenRXV](https://github.com/ilri/OpenRXV/commit/3816b9b3f3d9182d2ba1a899c1017c5895a59dee) so that we can lowercase AGROVOC subjects during harvesting

## 2020-11-11

- Atmire responded with a quote for the work to fix the duplicate owningComm, etc in our Solr data
  - I told them to proceed, as it's within our budget of credits
  - They will write a processor for DSpace 6 to remove the duplicates
- I did some tests to add a usage statistics chart to the item views on DSpace Test
  - It is inspired by Salem's work on WorldFish's repository, and it hits the dspace-statistics-api for the current item and displays a graph
  - I got it working very easily for all-time statistics with Chart.js, but I think I will need to use Highcharts or something else because Chart.js is HTML5 canvas and doesn't allow theming via CSS (so our Bootstrap brand colors for each theme won't work)
  - I think I'll pursue this after the DSpace 6 upgrade...

## 2020-11-12

- I was looking at Solr again trying to find a way to get community and collection stats by faceting on `owningComm` and `owningColl` and it seems to work actually
  - The duplicated values in the multi-value fields don't seem to affect the counts, as I had thought previously (though we should still get rid of them)
  - One major difference between the raw numbers I was looking at and Atmire's numbers is that Atmire's code filters "Internal" IP addresses...
  - Also, instead of doing `isBot:false` I think I should do `-isBot:true` because it's not a given that all documents will have this field and have it false, but we can definitely exclude the ones that have it as true
- First we get the total number of communities with stats (using calcdistinct):

```
facet=true&facet.field=owningComm&facet.mincount=1&facet.limit=1&facet.offset=0&stats=true&stats.field=owningComm&stats.calcdistinct=true&shards=http://localhost:8081/solr/statistics,http://localhost:8081/solr/statistics-2019,http://localhost:8081/solr/statistics-2018,http://localhost:8081/solr/statistics-2017,http://localhost:8081/solr/statistics-2016,http://localhost:8081/solr/statistics-2015,http://localhost:8081/solr/statistics-2014,http://localhost:8081/solr/statistics-2013,http://localhost:8081/solr/statistics-2012,http://localhost:8081/solr/statistics-2011,http://localhost:8081/solr/statistics-2010
```

- Then get stats themselves, iterating 100 items at a time with limit and offset:

```
facet=true&facet.field=owningComm&facet.mincount=1&facet.limit=100&facet.offset=0&shards=http://localhost:8081/solr/statistics,http://localhost:8081/solr/statistics-2019,http://localhost:8081/solr/statistics-2018,http://localhost:8081/solr/statistics-2017,http://localhost:8081/solr/statistics-2016,http://localhost:8081/solr/statistics-2015,http://localhost:8081/solr/statistics-2014,http://localhost:8081/solr/statistics-2013,http://localhost:8081/solr/statistics-2012,http://localhost:8081/solr/statistics-2011,http://localhost:8081/solr/statistics-2010
```

- I was surprised to see 10,000,000 docs with `isBot:true` when I was testing on DSpace Test...
  - This has got to be a mistake of some kind, as I see 4 million in 2014 that are from `dns:localhost.`, perhaps that's when we didn't have useProxies set up correctly?
  - I don't see the same thing on CGSpace... I wonder what happened?
  - Perhaps they got re-tagged during the DSpace 6 upgrade, somehow during the Solr migration? Hmmmmm. Definitely have to be careful with `isBot:true` in the future and not automatically purge these!!!
- I noticed 120,000+ hits from monit, FeedBurner, and Blackboard Safeassign in 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, etc...
  - I hadn't seen monit before, but the others are already in DSpace's spider agents lists for some time so probably only appear in older stats cores
  - The issue with purging these using `check-spider-hits.sh` is that it can't do case-insensitive regexes and some metacharacters like `\s` don't work so I added case-sensitive patterns to a local agents file and purged them with the script
