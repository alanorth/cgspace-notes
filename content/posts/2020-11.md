- Continue with processing the statistics-2019 Solr core with the AtomicStatisticsUpdateCLI tool on DSpace Test
  - So far we've spent at least fifty hours to process the statistics and statistics-2019 core... wow.

- Talk to Moayad and fix a few issues on OpenRXV:
  - Incorrect views and downloads (caused by Elasticsearch's default result set size of 10)
  - Invalid share link
  - Missing "https://" for Handles in the Simple Excel report (caused by using the `handle` instead of the `uri`)
  - Sorting the list of items by views
- I resumed the processing of the statistics-2018 Solr core after it spent 20 hours to get to 60%

## 2020-11-04

- After 29 hours the statistics-2017 core finished processing so I started the statistics-2016 core on DSpace Test

- Peter sent me corrections and deletions for the author affiliations
  - I quickly proofed them for UTF-8 issues in OpenRefine and csv-metadata-quality and then tested them locally and then applied them on CGSpace:

```
$ ./fix-metadata-values.py -i 2020-11-05-fix-862-affiliations.csv -db dspace -u dspace -p 'fuuu' -f cg.contributor.affiliation -t 'correct' -m 211
$ ./delete-metadata-values.py -i 2020-11-05-delete-29-affiliations.csv -db dspace -u dspace -p 'fuuu' -f cg.contributor.affiliation -m 211
```

- Then I started a Discovery re-index on CGSpace:

```
$ time chrt -b 0 ionice -c2 -n7 nice -n19 dspace index-discovery -b
```
