- Continue with processing the statistics-2019 Solr core with the AtomicStatisticsUpdateCLI tool on DSpace Test
  - So far we've spent at least fifty hours to process the statistics and statistics-2019 core... wow.

- Talk to Moayad and fix a few issues on OpenRXV:
  - Incorrect views and downloads (caused by Elasticsearch's default result set size of 10)
  - Invalid share link
  - Missing "https://" for Handles in the Simple Excel report (caused by using the `handle` instead of the `uri`)
  - Sorting the list of items by views
- I resumed the processing of the statistics-2018 Solr core after it spent 20 hours to get to 60%

## 2020-11-04

- After 29 hours the statistics-2017 core finished processing so I started the statistics-2016 core on DSpace Test
