- Look at the Solr statistics on CGSpace
  - I see 167,000 hits from a bunch of Microsoft IPs with reverse DNS "msnbot-" using the Solr query `dns:*msnbot* AND dns:*.msn.com`
  - I purged these first so I could see the other "real" IPs in the Solr facets
- I see 47,500 hits from 80.248.237.167 on a data center ISP in Sweden, using a normal user agent
- I see 13,000 hits from 163.237.216.11 on a data center ISP in Australia, using a normal user agent
- I see 7,300 hits from 208.185.238.57 from Britanica, using a normal user agent
  - There seem to be many more of these:

```console
# zcat --force /var/log/nginx/access.log* | grep 208.185.238. | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -h

- I see 3,000 hits from 178.208.75.33 by a Russian-owned IP in the Netherlands that is making a GET to / every one minute, using a normal user agent
- I see 3,000 hits from 134.122.124.196 on Digital Ocean to the REST API with a normal user agent
- I purged all these hits from IPs for a total of about 265,000
- Then I faceted by user agent and found
  - 1,000 hits by `insomnia/2022.2.1`, which I also saw last month and submitted to COUNTER-Robots
  - 265 hits by `omgili/0.5 +http://omgili.com`
  - 150 hits by `Vizzit`
  - 132 hits by `MetaInspector/5.7.0 (+https://github.com/jaimeiniesta/metainspector)`
  - 73 hits by `Scoop.it`
  - 62 hits by `bitdiscovery`

  - 32 hits by `Sprout Social (Link Attachment)`
  - 29 hits by `CyotekWebCopy/1.9 CyotekHTTP/6.2`
  - 20 hits by `Hootsuite-Authoring/1.0`
- I purged about 4,100 hits from these user agents
- Run all system updates on AReS server (linode20) and reboot
- I want to try to update some of the build dependencies of OpenRXV since Node.js 12 is no longer supported
- Upgrade linode20 to Ubuntu 22.04 and start an AReS harvest
