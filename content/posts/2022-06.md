## 2022-06-06

- Look at the Solr statistics on CGSpace
  - I see 167,000 hits from a bunch of Microsoft IPs with reverse DNS "msnbot-" using the Solr query `dns:*msnbot* AND dns:*.msn.com`
  - I purged these first so I could see the other "real" IPs in the Solr facets
- I see 47,500 hits from 80.248.237.167 on a data center ISP in Sweden, using a normal user agent
- I see 13,000 hits from 163.237.216.11 on a data center ISP in Australia, using a normal user agent
- I see 7,300 hits from 208.185.238.57 from Britanica, using a normal user agent
  - There seem to be many more of these:

```console
# zcat --force /var/log/nginx/access.log* | grep 208.185.238. | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -h
      2 208.185.238.1
    166 208.185.238.54
   1293 208.185.238.51
   2587 208.185.238.59
   4692 208.185.238.56
   5480 208.185.238.53
   6277 208.185.238.52
   6400 208.185.238.58
   8261 208.185.238.55
  17549 208.185.238.57
```

- I see 3,000 hits from 178.208.75.33 by a Russian-owned IP in the Netherlands that is making a GET to / every one minute, using a normal user agent
- I see 3,000 hits from 134.122.124.196 on Digital Ocean to the REST API with a normal user agent
- I purged all these hits from IPs for a total of about 265,000
- Then I faceted by user agent and found
  - 1,000 hits by `insomnia/2022.2.1`, which I also saw last month and submitted to COUNTER-Robots
  - 265 hits by `omgili/0.5 +http://omgili.com`
  - 150 hits by `Vizzit`
  - 132 hits by `MetaInspector/5.7.0 (+https://github.com/jaimeiniesta/metainspector)`
  - 73 hits by `Scoop.it`
  - 62 hits by `bitdiscovery`
  - 59 hits by `Asana/1.4.0 WebsiteMetadataRetriever`
  - 32 hits by `Sprout Social (Link Attachment)`
  - 29 hits by `CyotekWebCopy/1.9 CyotekHTTP/6.2`
  - 20 hits by `Hootsuite-Authoring/1.0`
- I purged about 4,100 hits from these user agents
- Run all system updates on AReS server (linode20) and reboot
- I want to try to update some of the build dependencies of OpenRXV since Node.js 12 is no longer supported
- Upgrade linode20 to Ubuntu 22.04 and start an AReS harvest
- I merged the [Mirage 2 build fix](https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/8292) to `dspace-6_x` for DSpace 6.4

## 2022-06-07

- I tested Node.js 14 one more time with vanilla DSpace 6.4-SNAPSHOT and with the CGSpace source and it worked well
  - I made [a pull request](https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/8331) to DSpace to use Node.js 14 for Mirage 2
  - I even tested Node.js 16 and it works, but that is enough for now...

## 2022-06-08

- Work on AReS a bit since I wasn't able to harvest after doing the updates on the server and in the containers a few days ago
  - I don't know what the problem was really, but on the server I had to enable IPv4 forwarding so the frontend container would build
  - Once I downed and upped AReS with docker-compose I was able to start a new harvest
  - I also did some tests to enable ES2020 target in the backend because we're on Node.js 14 there now

## 2022-06-13

- Create a user for Mohammed Salem to test MEL submission on DSpace Test:

```console
$ dspace user -a -m mel-submit@cgiar.org -g MEL -s Submit -p 'owwwwwwww'
```

- According to my notes from [2020-10]({{< relref "2020-10.md" >}}) the account must be in the admin group in order to submit via the REST API

## 2022-06-14

- Start a harvest on AReS

## 2022-06-16

- Francesca asked us to add the CC-BY-3.0-IGO license to the submission form on CGSpace
  - I remember I [had requested SPDX to add CC-BY-NC-ND-3.0-IGO](https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/issues/767) in 2019-02, and they finally [merged it](https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/pull/1068) in 2020-07, but I never added it to CGSpace
  - I will add the full suite of CC 3.0 IGO licenses to CGSpace and then make a request to SPDX for the others:
		- CC-BY-3.0-IGO
		- CC-BY-SA-3.0-IGO
		- CC-BY-ND-3.0-IGO
		- CC-BY-NC-3.0-IGO
		- CC-BY-NC-SA-3.0-IGO
		- CC-BY-NC-ND-3.0-IGO
- I filed [an issue asking for SPDX to add CC-BY-3.0-IGO](https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/issues/1525)
- Meeting with Moayad from CodeObia to discuss OpenRXV
  - He added the ability to use multiple indexes / dashboards, and to be able to embed them in iframes
- Add `cg.contributor.initiative` with a controlled vocabulary based on CLARISA's list to the CGSpace submission form
- Switch to the `linux-virtual-hwe-20.04` kernel on CGSpace (linode18), run all system updates, and reboot

## 2022-06-17

- I noticed a few ORCID identifiers missing for some scientists so I added them to the controlled vocabulary and then tagged them on CGSpace:

```console
$ cat 2022-06-17-add-orcids.csv
dc.contributor.author,cg.creator.identifier
"Tijjani, A.","Abdulfatai Tijjani: 0000-0002-0793-9059"

$ ./ilri/add-orcid-identifiers-csv.py -i /tmp/2022-06-17-add-orcids.csv -db dspace -u dspace -p 'fuuu' | tee /tmp/orcids.log
$ grep -c 'Adding ORCID' /tmp/orcids2.log 
304
```

- Also make some changes to the Discovery facets and item view
  - I reduced the number of items to show for CRP facets from 20 to 5
  - I added a facet for the Initiatives
  - I re-organized a few parts of the item view to add Action Areas and the list of author affiliations

## 2022-06-18

- I deployed the changes on CGSpace and started a full Discovery index for the new Initiatives facet
- Run `dspace cleanup -v` on CGSpace
