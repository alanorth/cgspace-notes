## 2020-03-02

- Update [dspace-statistics-api](https://github.com/ilri/dspace-statistics-api) for DSpace 6+ UUIDs
  - Tag version 1.2.0 on GitHub
- Test migrating legacy Solr statistics to UUIDs with the as-of-yet unreleased [SolrUpgradePre6xStatistics.java](https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/commit/184f2b2153479045fba6239342c63e7f8564b8b6#diff-0350ce2e13b28d5d61252b7a8f50a059)
  - You need to download this into the DSpace 6.x source and compile it

```
$ export JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx1024m -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8"
$ ~/dspace63/bin/dspace solr-upgrade-statistics-6x
```

## 2020-03-03

- Skype with Peter and Abenet to discuss the CG Core survey
  - We also discussed some other CGSpace issues

## 2020-03-04

- Abenet asked me to add some new ILRI subjects to CGSpace
  - I [updated the input-forms.xml](https://github.com/ilri/DSpace/commit/b51a242e773bd8658d3cab4ac883975708b00386) in our `5_x-prod` branch on GitHub
  - Abenet said we are changing `HEALTH` to `HUMAN HEALTH` so I need to fix those using my `fix-metadata-values.py` script:

```
$ ./fix-metadata-values.py -i 2020-03-04-fix-1-ilri-subject.csv -db dspace -u dspace -p 'fuuu' -f cg.subject.ilri -m 203 -t correct -d
```

- But I have not run it on CGSpace yet because we want to ask Peter if he is sure about it...
- Send a message to Macaroni Bros to ask them about their Drupal module and its readiness for DSpace 6 UUIDs
