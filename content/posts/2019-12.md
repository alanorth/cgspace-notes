## 2019-12-01

- Upgrade CGSpace (linode18) to Ubuntu 18.04:
  - Check any packages that have residual configs and purge them:
  - <code># dpkg -l | grep -E '^rc' | awk '{print $2}' | xargs dpkg -P</code>
  - Make sure all packages are up to date and the package manager is up to date, then reboot:

```
# apt update && apt full-upgrade
# apt-get autoremove && apt-get autoclean
# dpkg -C
# reboot
```

<!--more-->

  - Take some backups:

```
# dpkg -l > 2019-12-01-linode18-dpkg.txt
# tar czf 2019-12-01-linode18-etc.tar.gz /etc
```
  - Then check all third-party repositories in /etc/apt to see if everything using "xenial" has packages available for "bionic" and then update the sources:
  - <code># sed -i 's/xenial/bionic/' /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*.list</code>
  - Pause the Uptime Robot monitoring for CGSpace
  - Make sure the update manager is installed and do the upgrade:

```
# apt install update-manager-core
# do-release-upgrade
```

  - After the upgrade finishes, remove Java 11, force the installation of bionic nginx, and reboot the server:

```
# apt purge openjdk-11-jre-headless
# apt install 'nginx=1.16.1-1~bionic'
# reboot
```

  - After the server comes back up, remove Python virtualenvs that were created with Python 3.5 and re-run certbot to make sure it's working:

```
# rm -rf /opt/eff.org/certbot/venv/bin/letsencrypt
# rm -rf /opt/ilri/dspace-statistics-api/venv
# /opt/certbot-auto
```

  - Clear Ansible's fact cache and re-run the playbooks to update the system's firewalls, SSH config, etc
- Altmetric finally responded to my question about Dublin Core fields
  - They shared a [list of fields they use for tracking](https://help.altmetric.com/support/solutions/articles/6000141419-what-metadata-is-required-to-track-our-content-), but it only mentions HTML meta tags, and not fields considered when harvesting via OAI
  - Anyways, there might be some areas we can improve on the HTML meta tags, if I look at one [item with a DOI, ISSN, etc](https://hdl.handle.net/10568/101623) I see that we could at least add status (Open Access) and journal title
  - I merged a [pull request](https://github.com/ilri/DSpace/pull/438) into the `5_x-prod` branch to add status and journal title to the XHTML meta tags

## 2019-12-02

- Raise the issue of old, low-quality thumbnails with Peter and the CGSpace team
  - I suggested that we move manually uploaded thumbnails from the `ORIGINAL` bundle to the `THUMBNAIL` bundle
  - Also replace old thumbnails where an item is available on Slideshare or YouTube because those are easy to get new, high-quality thumbnails for
- Continue testing CG Core v2 implementation on DSpace Test
  - Compare the OAI QDC representation of a few items on CGSpace vs DSpace Test:

```
$ http 'https://cgspace.cgiar.org/oai/request?verb=GetRecord&metadataPrefix=oai_dc&identifier=oai:cgspace.cgiar.org:10568/104030' > /tmp/cgspace-104030.xml
$ http 'https://dspacetest.cgiar.org/oai/request?verb=GetRecord&metadataPrefix=oai_dc&identifier=oai:cgspace.cgiar.org:10568/104030' > /tmp/dspacetest-104030.xml
```

  - The DSpace Test ones actually now capture the DOI, where the CGSpace doesn't...
  - And the DSpace Test one doesn't include review status as `dc.description`, but I don't think that's an important field 

## 2019-12-04

- Peter noticed that there were about seventy items on CGSpace that were marked as private
  - Some have been withdrawn, but I extracted a list of the forty-eight that were not:

```
dspace=# \COPY (SELECT handle, owning_collection FROM item, handle WHERE item.discoverable='f' AND item.in_archive='t' AND handle.resource_id = item.item_id) to /tmp/2019-12-04-CGSpace-private-items.csv WITH CSV HEADER;
COPY 48
```

## 2019-12-05

- Give [presentation about CG Core v2](https://hdl.handle.net/10568/106045) to the MEL Developers' Retreat in Nairobi, Kenya (via Skype)
- Send some pull requests to the cg-core schema repository:
  - [HTML syntax fixes](https://github.com/AgriculturalSemantics/cg-core/pull/16)
  - [Add LICENSE file](https://github.com/AgriculturalSemantics/cg-core/pull/17)
  - [Build main.css using npm build](https://github.com/AgriculturalSemantics/cg-core/pull/18)

## 2019-12-08

- Enrico noticed that the AReS Explorer on CGSpace (linode18) was down
  - I only see HTTP 502 in the nginx logs on CGSpace... so I assume it's something wrong with the AReS server
  - I ran all system updates on the AReS server (linode20) and rebooted it
  - After rebooting the Explorer was accessible again

## 2019-12-09

- Update PostgreSQL JDBC driver to [version 42.2.9](https://jdbc.postgresql.org/documentation/changelog.html#version_42.2.9) in [Ansible playbooks](https://github.com/ilri/rmg-ansible-public)
  - Deploy on DSpace Test (linode19) to test before deploying on CGSpace in a few days
