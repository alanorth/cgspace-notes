## 2022-10-01

- Start a harvest on AReS last night
- Yesterday I realized how to use [GraphicsMagick with im4java](https://im4java.sourceforge.net/docs/dev-guide.html) and I want to re-visit some of my thumbnail tests
  - I'm also interested in libvips support via jVips, though last time I checked it was only for Java 8
  - I filed [an issue to ask about Java 11+ support](https://github.com/criteo/JVips/issues/141)
