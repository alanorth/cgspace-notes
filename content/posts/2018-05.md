## 2018-05-01

- I cleared the Solr statistics core on DSpace Test by issuing two commands directly to the Solr admin interface:
  - http://localhost:3000/solr/statistics/update?stream.body=%3Cdelete%3E%3Cquery%3E*:*%3C/query%3E%3C/delete%3E
  - http://localhost:3000/solr/statistics/update?stream.body=%3Ccommit/%3E
- Then I reduced the JVM heap size from 6144 back to 5120m
- Also, I switched it to use OpenJDK instead of Oracle Java, as well as re-worked the [Ansible infrastructure scripts](https://github.com/ilri/rmg-ansible-public) to support hosts choosing which distribution they want to use

## 2018-05-02

- Advise Fabio Fidanza about integrating CGSpace content in the new CGIAR corporate website
- I think they can mostly rely on using the `cg.contributor.crp` field
- Looking over some IITA records for Sisay
  - Other than trimming and collapsing consecutive whitespace, I made some other corrections
  - I need to check the correct formatting of COTE D'IVOIRE vs COTE D’IVOIRE
  - I replaced all DOIs with HTTPS
  - I checked a few DOIs and found at least one that was missing, so I Googled the title of the paper and found the correct DOI
  - Also, I found an [FAQ for DOI that says the `dx.doi.org` syntax is older](https://www.doi.org/factsheets/DOI_PURL.html), so I will replace all the DOIs with `doi.org` instead
  - I found five records with "ISI Jounal" instead of "ISI Journal"
  - I found one item with IITA subject "."
  - Need to remember to check the facets for things like this in sponsorship:
    - Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit
    - Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Internationale Zusammenarbeit
  - Eight records with language "fn" instead of "fr"
  - One incorrect type (lowercase "proceedings"): Conference proceedings
  - Found some capitalized CRPs in `cg.contributor.crp`
  - Found some incorrect author affiliations, ie "Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement Agricolc" should be "Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement *Agricole*"
  - Wow, and for sponsors there are the following:
    - Incorrect: Flemish Agency for Development Cooperation and Technical Assistance
    - Incorrect: Flemish Organization for Development Cooperation and Technical Assistance
    - Correct: Flemish *Association* for Development Cooperation and Technical Assistance
  - One item had region "WEST" (I corrected it to "WEST AFRICA")

## 2018-05-03

- It turns out that the IITA records that I was helping Sisay with in March were imported in 2018-04 without a final check by Abenet or I
- There are lots of errors on language, CRP, and even some encoding errors on abstract fields
- I export them and include the hidden metadata fields like `dc.date.accessioned` so I can filter the ones from 2018-04 and correct them in Open Refine:

```
$ dspace metadata-export -a -f /tmp/iita.csv -i 10568/68616
```

- Abenet sent a list of 46 ORCID identifiers for ILRI authors so I need to get their names using my [resolve-orcids.py](https://gist.github.com/alanorth/57a88379126d844563c1410bd7b8d12b) script and merge them into our controlled vocabulary
- On the messed up IITA records from 2018-04 I see sixty DOIs in incorrect format (cg.identifier.doi)

## 2018-05-06

- Fixing the IITA records from Sisay, sixty DOIs have completely invalid format like `http:dx.doi.org10.1016j.cropro.2008.07.003`
- I corrected all the DOIs and then checked them for validity with a quick bash loop:

```
$ for line in $(< /tmp/links.txt); do echo $line; http --print h $line; done
```

- Most of the links are good, though one is duplicate and one seems to even be incorrect in the publisher's site so...
- Also, there are some duplicates:
  - `10568/92241` and `10568/92230` (same DOI)
  - `10568/92151` and `10568/92150` (same ISBN)
  - `10568/92291` and `10568/92286` (same citation, title, authors, year)
- Messed up abstracts:
  - `10568/92309`
- Fixed some issues in regions, countries, sponsors, ISSN, and cleaned whitespace errors from citation, abstract, author, and titles
- Fixed all issues with CRPs
- A few more interesting Unicode characters to look for in text fields like author, abstracts, and citations  might be: `’` (0x2019), `·` (0x00b7), and `€` (0x20ac)
- A custom text facit in OpenRefine with this GREL expression could be a good for finding invalid characters or encoding errors in authors, abstracts, etc:

```
or(
  isNotNull(value.match(/.*[(|)].*/)),
  isNotNull(value.match(/.*\uFFFD.*/)),
  isNotNull(value.match(/.*\u00A0.*/)),
  isNotNull(value.match(/.*\u200A.*/)),
  isNotNull(value.match(/.*\u2019.*/)),
  isNotNull(value.match(/.*\u00b7.*/)),
  isNotNull(value.match(/.*\u20ac.*/))
)
```

- I found some more IITA records that Sisay imported on 2018-03-23 that have invalid CRP names, so now I kinda want to check those ones!
- Combine the ORCID identifiers Abenet sent with our existing list and resolve their names using the [resolve-orcids.py](https://gist.github.com/alanorth/57a88379126d844563c1410bd7b8d12b) script:

```
$ cat ~/src/git/DSpace/dspace/config/controlled-vocabularies/cg-creator-id.xml /tmp/ilri-orcids.txt | grep -oE '[A-Z0-9]{4}-[A-Z0-9]{4}-[A-Z0-9]{4}-[A-Z0-9]{4}' | sort | uniq > /tmp/2018-05-06-combined.txt
$ ./resolve-orcids.py -i /tmp/2018-05-06-combined.txt -o /tmp/2018-05-06-combined-names.txt -d
# sort names, copy to cg-creator-id.xml, add XML formatting, and then format with tidy (preserving accents)
$ tidy -xml -utf8 -iq -m -w 0 dspace/config/controlled-vocabularies/cg-creator-id.xml
```

- I made a pull request ([#373](https://github.com/ilri/DSpace/pull/373)) for this that I'll merge some time next week (I'm expecting Atmire to get back to us about DSpace 5.8 soon)
- After testing quickly I just decided to merge it, and I noticed that I don't even need to restart Tomcat for the changes to get loaded

## 2018-05-07

- I spent a bit of time playing with [conciliator](https://github.com/codeforkjeff/conciliator) and Solr, trying to figure out how to reconcile columns in OpenRefine with data in our existing Solr cores (like CRP subjects)
- The documentation regarding the Solr stuff is limited, and I cannot figure out what all the fields in `conciliator.properties` are supposed to be
- But then I found [reconcile-csv](https://github.com/okfn/reconcile-csv), which allows you to reconcile against values in a CSV file!
- That, combined with splitting our multi-value fields on "||" in OpenRefine is amaaaaazing, because after reconciliation you can just join them again
- Oh wow, you can also facet on the individual values once you've split them! That's going to be amazing for proofing CRPs, subjects, etc.

## 2018-05-09

- Udana asked about the Book Chapters we had been proofing on DSpace Test in 2018-04
- I told him that there were still some TODO items for him on that data, for example to update the `dc.language.iso` field for the Spanish items
- I was trying to remember how I parsed the `input-forms.xml` using `xmllint` to extract subjects neatly
- I could use it with [reconcile-csv](https://github.com/okfn/reconcile-csv) or to populate a Solr instance for reconciliation
- This XPath expression gets close, but outputs all items on one line:

```
$ xmllint --xpath '//value-pairs[@value-pairs-name="crpsubject"]/pair/stored-value/node()' dspace/config/input-forms.xml

```

- Maybe `xmlstarlet` is better:

```
$ xmlstarlet sel -t -v '//value-pairs[@value-pairs-name="crpsubject"]/pair/stored-value/text()' dspace/config/input-forms.xml

- Discuss Colombian BNARS harvesting the CIAT data from CGSpace
- They are using a system called Primo and the only options for data harvesting in that system are via FTP and OAI
- I told them to get all [CIAT records via OAI](https://cgspace.cgiar.org/oai/request?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=oai_dc&set=com_10568_35697)
- Just a note to myself, I figured out how to get reconcile-csv to run from source rather than running the old pre-compiled JAR file:

```
$ lein run /tmp/crps.csv id
```

- I tried to reconcile against a CSV of our countries but reconcile-csv crashes

## 2018-05-13

- It turns out there was a space in my "country" header that was causing reconcile-csv to crash
- After removing that it works fine!
- Looking at Sisay's 2,640 CIFOR records on DSpace Test ([10568/92904](https://dspacetest.cgiar.org/handle/10568/92904))
  - Trimmed all leading / trailing white space and condensed multiple spaces into one
  - Corrected DOIs to use HTTPS and "doi.org" instead of "dx.doi.org"
    - There are eight items in `cg.identifier.doi` that are not DOIs)
  - Corrected `cg.identifier.url` links to cifor.org to use HTTPS
  - Corrected `dc.language.iso` from vt to vi (Vietnamese)
  - Corrected affiliations to not use acronyms
  - Reconcile countries against our countries list (removing terms like LATIN AMERICA, CENTRAL AFRICA, etc that are not countries)
  - Reconcile regions against our list of regions

## 2018-05-14

- Send a message to the OpenRefine mailing list about the bug with reconciling multi-value cells
- Help Silvia Alonso get a list of all her publications since 2013 from Listings and Reports

## 2018-05-15

- Turns out I was doing the OpenRefine reconciliation wrong: I needed to copy the matched values to a new column!
- Also, I learned how to do something cool with Jython expressions in OpenRefine
- This will fetch a URL and return its HTTP response code:

```
import urllib2
import re

pattern = re.compile('.*10.1016.*')
if pattern.match(value):
  get = urllib2.urlopen(value)
  return get.getcode()

return "blank"
```

- I used a regex to limit it to just some of the DOIs in this case because there were thousands of URLs
- Here the response code would be 200, 404, etc, or "blank" if there is no URL for that item
- You could use this in a facet or in a new column
- More information and good examples here: https://programminghistorian.org/lessons/fetch-and-parse-data-with-openrefine
- Finish looking at the 2,640 CIFOR records on DSpace Test ([10568/92904](https://dspacetest.cgiar.org/handle/10568/92904)), cleaning up authors and adding collection mappings
- They can now be moved to CGSpace as far as I'm concerned, but I don't know if Sisay will do it or me
- I was checking the CIFOR data for duplicates using Atmire's Metadata Quality Module (and found some duplicates actually), but then DSpace died...
- I didn't see anything in the Tomcat, DSpace, or Solr logs, but I saw this in `dmest -T`:

```
[Tue May 15 12:10:01 2018] Out of memory: Kill process 3763 (java) score 706 or sacrifice child
[Tue May 15 12:10:01 2018] Killed process 3763 (java) total-vm:14667688kB, anon-rss:5705268kB, file-rss:0kB, shmem-rss:0kB
[Tue May 15 12:10:01 2018] oom_reaper: reaped process 3763 (java), now anon-rss:0kB, file-rss:0kB, shmem-rss:0kB
```

- So the Linux kernel killed Java...
- Maria from Bioversity mailed to say she got an error while submitting an item on CGSpace:

```
Unable to load Submission Information, since WorkspaceID (ID:S96060) is not a valid in-process submission
```

- Looking in the DSpace log I see something related:

```
2018-05-15 12:35:30,858 INFO  org.dspace.submit.step.CompleteStep @ m.garruccio@cgiar.org:session_id=8AC4499945F38B45EF7A1226E3042DAE:submission_complete:Completed submission with id=96060
```

- So I'm not sure...
- I finally figured out how to get OpenRefine to reconcile values from Solr via [conciliator](https://github.com/codeforkjeff/conciliator):
- The trick was to use a more appropriate Solr fieldType `text_en` instead of `text_general` so that more terms match, for example uppercase and lower case:

```
$ ./bin/solr start
$ ./bin/solr create_core -c countries
$ curl -X POST -H 'Content-type:application/json' --data-binary '{"add-field": {"name":"country", "type":"text_en", "multiValued":false, "stored":true}}' http://localhost:8983/solr/countries/schema
$ ./bin/post -c countries ~/src/git/DSpace/2018-05-10-countries.csv
```

- It still doesn't catch simple mistakes like "ALBANI" or "AL BANIA" for "ALBANIA", and it doesn't return scores, so I have to select matches manually:

![OpenRefine reconciling countries from local Solr](/cgspace-notes/2018/05/openrefine-solr-conciliator.png)

- I should probably make a general copy field and set it to be the default search field, like DSpace's search core does (see schema.xml):

```
<defaultSearchField>search_text</defaultSearchField>
...
<copyField source="*" dest="search_text"/>
```

- Actually, I wonder how much of their schema I could just copy...
- Apparently the default search field is the `df` parameter and you could technically just add it to the query string, so no need to bother with that in the schema now
- I copied over the DSpace `search_text` field type from the DSpace Solr config (had to remove some properties so Solr would start) but it doesn't seem to be any better at matching than the `text_en` type
- I think I need to focus on trying to return scores with conciliator

## 2018-05-16

- Discuss GDPR with James Stapleton
  - As far as I see it, we are "Data Controllers" on CGSpace because we store peoples' names, emails, and phone numbers if they register
  - We set cookies on the user's computer, but these do not contain personally identifiable information (PII) and they are "session" cookies which are deleted when the user closes their browser
  - We use Google Analytics to track website usage, which makes Google the "Data Processor" and in this case we merely need to *limit* or *obfuscate* the information we send to them
  - As the only personally identifiable information we send is the user's IP address, I think we only need to enable [IP Address Anonymization](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052) in our `analytics.js` code snippets
  - Then we can add a "Privacy" page to CGSpace that makes all of this clear
- Silvia asked if I could sort the records in her Listings and Report output and it turns out that the options are misconfigured in `dspace/config/modules/atmire-listings-and-reports.cfg`
- I created and merged a pull request to fix the sorting issue in Listings and Reports ([#374](https://github.com/ilri/DSpace/pull/374))
- Regarding the IP Address Anonymization for GDPR, I ammended the Google Analytics snippet in `page-structure-alterations.xsl` to:

```
ga('send', 'pageview', {
  'anonymizeIp': true
});
```

- I tested loading a certain page before and after adding this and afterwards I saw that the parameter `aip=1` was being sent with the analytics response to Google
- According to the [analytics.js protocol parameter documentation](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/field-reference#anonymizeIp) this means that IPs are being anonymized
- After finding and fixing some duplicates in IITA's `IITA_April_27` test collection on DSpace Test (10568/92703) I told Sisay that he can move them to IITA's Journal Articles collection on CGSpace

## 2018-05-17

- Testing reconciliation of countries against Solr via conciliator, I notice that `CÔTE D'IVOIRE` doesn't match `COTE D'IVOIRE`, whereas with reconcile-csv it does
- Also, when reconciling regions against Solr via conciliator `EASTERN AFRICA` doesn't match `EAST AFRICA`, whereas with reconcile-csv it does
- And `SOUTH AMERICA` matches both `SOUTH ASIA` and `SOUTH AMERICA` with the same match score of 2... WTF.
- It could be that I just need to tune the query filter in Solr (currently using the example `text_en` field type)
- Oh sweet, it turns out that the issue with searching for characters with accents is called "code folding" in Solr
- You can use either a [`solr.ASCIIFoldingFilterFactory` filter](https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/7_3/language-analysis.html) or a [`solr.MappingCharFilterFactory` charFilter](https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/7_3/charfilterfactories.html) mapping against `mapping-FoldToASCII.txt`
- Also see: https://opensourceconnections.com/blog/2017/02/20/solr-utf8/
- Now `CÔTE D'IVOIRE` matches `COTE D'IVOIRE`!
- I'm not sure which method is better, perhaps the `solr.ASCIIFoldingFilterFactory` filter because it doesn't require copying the `mapping-FoldToASCII.txt` file
- And actually I'm not entirely sure about the order of filtering before tokenizing, etc...
- Ah, I see that `charFilter` must be before the tokenizer because it works on a stream, whereas `filter` operates on tokenized input so it must come after the tokenizer
- Regarding the use of the `charFilter` vs the `filter` class before and after the tokenizer, respectively, I think it's better to use the `charFilter` to normalize the input stream before tokenizing it as I have no idea what kinda stuff might get removed by the tokenizer
- Skype with Geoffrey from IITA in Nairobi who wants to deposit records to CGSpace via the REST API but I told him that this skips the submission workflows and because we cannot guarantee the data quality we would not allow anyone to use it this way
- I finished making the XMLUI changes for anonymization of IP addresses in Google Analytics and merged the changes to the `5_x-prod` branch ([#375](https://github.com/ilri/DSpace/pull/375)
- Also, I think we might be able to implement [opt-out functionality for Google Analytics using a window property](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/user-opt-out) that could be managed by [storing its status in a cookie](https://webgilde.com/en/analytics-opt-out/)
- This cookie could be set by a user clicking a link in a privacy policy, for example
- The additional Javascript could be easily added to our existing `googleAnalytics` template in each XMLUI theme

## 2018-05-18

- Do a final check on the thirty (30) IWMI Book Chapters for Udana and upload them to CGSpace
- These were previously on [DSpace Test as "IWMI test collection"](https://dspacetest.cgiar.org/handle/10568/91679) in 2018-04

## 2018-05-20

- Run all system updates on DSpace Test (linode19), re-deploy DSpace with latest `5_x-dev` branch (including GDPR IP anonymization), and reboot the server
- Run all system updates on CGSpace (linode18), re-deploy DSpace with latest `5_x-dev` branch (including GDPR IP anonymization), and reboot the server

## 2018-05-21

- Geoffrey from IITA got back with more questions about depositing items programatically into the CGSpace workflow
- I pointed out that [SWORD](http://swordapp.org/) might be an option, as [DSpace supports the SWORDv2 protocol](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSDOC5x/SWORDv2+Server) (although we have never tested it)
- Work on implementing [cookie consent](https://cookieconsent.insites.com) popup for all XMLUI themes (SASS theme with primary / secondary branding from Bootstrap)

## 2018-05-22

- Skype with James Stapleton about last minute GDPR wording
- After spending yesterday working on integration and theming of the cookieconsent popup, today I cannot get the damn "Agree" button to dismiss the popup!
- I tried calling it several ways, via jQuery, via a function in `page-structure-alterations.xsl`, via script tags in `<head>` in `page-structure.xsl`, and a few others
- The only way it actually works is if I paste it into the community or collection HTML
- Oh, actually in testing it appears this is not true
- This is a waste of TWO full days of work
- Marissa Van Epp asked if I could add `PII-FP1_PACCA2` to the CCAFS phase II project tags on CGSpace so I created a ticket to track it ([#376](https://github.com/ilri/DSpace/issues/376))

## 2018-05-23

- I'm investigating how many non-CGIAR users we have registered on CGSpace:

```
dspace=# select email, netid from eperson where email not like '%cgiar.org%' and email like '%@%';
```

- We might need to do something regarding these users for GDPR compliance because we have their names, emails, and potentially phone numbers
- I decided that I will just use the cookieconsent script as is, since it looks good and technically does set the cookie with "allow" or "dismiss"
- I wrote a quick conditional to check if the user has agreed or not before enabling Google Analytics
- I made a pull request for the GDPR compliance popup ([#377](https://github.com/ilri/DSpace/pull/377)) and merged it to the `5_x-prod` branch
- I will deploy it to CGSpace tonight

## 2018-05-28

- Daniel Haile-Michael sent a message that CGSpace was down (I am currently in Oregon so the time difference is ~10 hours)
- I looked in the logs but didn't see anything that would be the cause of the crash
