## 2018-05-01

- I cleared the Solr statistics core on DSpace Test by issuing two commands directly to the Solr admin interface:
  - http://localhost:3000/solr/statistics/update?stream.body=%3Cdelete%3E%3Cquery%3E*:*%3C/query%3E%3C/delete%3E
  - http://localhost:3000/solr/statistics/update?stream.body=%3Ccommit/%3E
- Then I reduced the JVM heap size from 6144 back to 5120m
- Also, I switched it to use OpenJDK instead of Oracle Java, as well as re-worked the [Ansible infrastructure scripts](https://github.com/ilri/rmg-ansible-public) to support hosts choosing which distribution they want to use

## 2018-05-02

- Advise Fabio Fidanza about integrating CGSpace content in the new CGIAR corporate website
- I think they can mostly rely on using the `cg.contributor.crp` field
- Looking over some IITA records for Sisay
  - Other than trimming and collapsing consecutive whitespace, I made some other corrections
  - I need to check the correct formatting of COTE D'IVOIRE vs COTE D’IVOIRE
  - I replaced all DOIs with HTTPS
  - I checked a few DOIs and found at least one that was missing, so I Googled the title of the paper and found the correct DOI
  - Also, I found an [FAQ for DOI that says the `dx.doi.org` syntax is older](https://www.doi.org/factsheets/DOI_PURL.html), so I will replace all the DOIs with `doi.org` instead
  - I found five records with "ISI Jounal" instead of "ISI Journal"
  - I found one item with IITA subject "."
  - Need to remember to check the facets for things like this in sponsorship:
    - Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit
    - Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Internationale Zusammenarbeit
  - Eight records with language "fn" instead of "fr"
  - One incorrect type (lowercase "proceedings"): Conference proceedings
  - Found some capitalized CRPs in `cg.contributor.crp`
  - Found some incorrect author affiliations, ie "Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement Agricolc" should be "Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement *Agricole*"
  - Wow, and for sponsors there are the following:
    - Incorrect: Flemish Agency for Development Cooperation and Technical Assistance
    - Incorrect: Flemish Organization for Development Cooperation and Technical Assistance
    - Correct: Flemish *Association* for Development Cooperation and Technical Assistance
  - One item had region "WEST" (I corrected it to "WEST AFRICA")

## 2018-05-03

- It turns out that the IITA records that I was helping Sisay with in March were imported in 2018-04 without a final check by Abenet or I
- There are lots of errors on language, CRP, and even some encoding errors on abstract fields
