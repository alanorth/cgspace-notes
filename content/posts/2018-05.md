## 2018-05-01

- I cleared the Solr statistics core on DSpace Test by issuing two commands directly to the Solr admin interface:
  - http://localhost:3000/solr/statistics/update?stream.body=%3Cdelete%3E%3Cquery%3E*:*%3C/query%3E%3C/delete%3E
  - http://localhost:3000/solr/statistics/update?stream.body=%3Ccommit/%3E
- Then I reduced the JVM heap size from 6144 back to 5120m
- Also, I switched it to use OpenJDK instead of Oracle Java, as well as re-worked the [Ansible infrastructure scripts](https://github.com/ilri/rmg-ansible-public) to support hosts choosing which distribution they want to use
