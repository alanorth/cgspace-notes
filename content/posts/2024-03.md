## 2024-03-01

- Last week Bizu reported an issue with the "browse by issue date" drop down
  - I verified it, and suspect it could be due to missing issue dates...
  - It might be this issue: https://github.com/DSpace/dspace-angular/issues/2808

- I spent some time trying to reproduce the bug affecting `onebox` fields that are configured to use external vocabularies and are not repeatable
  - I filed an issue: https://github.com/DSpace/dspace-angular/issues/2846

## 2024-03-03

- I did some cleanups on abstracts, licenses, and dates from CrossRef
- I also did some minor cleanups to affiliations because I saw some incorrect and duplicate ones in our list
