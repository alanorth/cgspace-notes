## 2023-02-01

- Export CGSpace to cross check the DOI metadata with Crossref
  - I want to try to expand my use of their data to journals, publishers, volumes, issues, etc...

<!--more-->

- First, extract a list of DOIs for use with `crossref-doi-lookup.py`:

```console
$ csvcut -c 'cg.identifier.doi[en_US]' ~/Downloads/2023-02-01-cgspace.csv \
  | csvgrep -c 1 -m 'doi.org' \
  | csvgrep -c 1 -m ' ' -i \
  | csvgrep -c 1 -r '.*cifor.*' -i \
  | sed 1d > /tmp/2023-02-01-dois.txt
$ ./ilri/crossref-doi-lookup.py -e a.orth@cgiar.org -i /tmp/2023-02-01-dois.txt -o ~/Downloads/2023-01-31-crossref-results.csv -d
```

- Then extract the ID, DOI, journal, volume, issue, publisher, etc from the CGSpace dump and rename the `cg.identifier.doi[en_US]` to `doi` so we can join on it with the Crossref results file:

```console
$ csvcut -c 'id,cg.identifier.doi[en_US],cg.journal[en_US],cg.volume[en_US],cg.issue[en_US],dcterms.publisher[en_US],cg.number[en_US],dcterms.license[en_US]' ~/Downloads/2023-02-01-cgspace.csv \
  | csvgrep -c 'cg.identifier.doi[en_US]' -r '.*cifor.*' -i \
  | sed -e '1s/cg.identifier.doi\[en_US\]/doi/' \
    -e 's_https://doi.org/__g' \
    -e 's_https://dx.doi.org/__g' \
  > /tmp/2023-02-01-cgspace-doi-metadata.csv
$ csvjoin -c doi /tmp/2023-02-01-cgspace-doi-metadata.csv ~/Downloads/2023-02-01-crossref-results.csv > /tmp/2023-02-01-cgspace-crossref-check.csv
```

- And import into OpenRefine for analysis and cleaning
- I just noticed that Crossref also has types, so we could use that in the future too!
- I got a few corrections after examining manually, but I didn't manage to identify any patterns that I could use to do any automatic matching or cleaning

## 2023-02-05

- Normalize text lang attributes in PostgreSQL, run a quick Discovery index, and then export CGSpace to check Initiative mappings and countries/regions
- Run all system updates on CGSpace (linode18) and reboot it

## 2023-02-06

- Peter said that a new Initiative was approved last month so we need to add it to CGSpace: `Fragility, Conflict, and Migration`
- There is lots of discussion about the "issue date" versus "available date" with Enrico and IFPRI, after lots of feedback from the PRMS QA
  - I filed [an issue on CG Core to propose using `dcterms.available` as an optional field to indicate the online date](https://github.com/AgriculturalSemantics/cg-core/issues/43)


## 2023-02-07

- IFPRI's web developer Tony managed to get his Drupal harvester to have a useful user agent:

```console
54.x.x.x - - [06/Feb/2023:10:10:32 +0100] "POST /rest/items/find-by-metadata-field?limit=%22100&offset=0 HTTP/1.1" 200 58855 "-" "IFPRI drupal POST harvester"
```

- He also noticed that there is no pagination on POST requests to `/rest/items/find-by-metadata-field`, and that he needs to increase his timeout for requests that return 100+ results, ie:


```console
curl -f -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST "https://dspacetest.cgiar.org/rest/items/find-by-metadata-field" -d '{"key":"cg.subject.actionArea", "value":"Systems Transformation", "language": "en_US"}'
```

- I need to ask on the DSpace Slack about this POST pagination
- Abenet and Udana noticed that the Handle server was not running
  - Looking in the `error.log` file I see that the service is complaining about a lock file being present
  - This is because Linode had to do emergency maintenance on the VM host this morning and the Handle server didn't shut down properly
- I'm having an issue with `poetry update` so I spent some time debugging and filed [an issue](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/7482)
- Proof and import nine items for the Digital Innovation Inititive for IFPRI
  - There were only some minor issues in the metadata
  - I also did a duplicate check with `check-duplicates.py` just in case
- I did some minor updates on csv-metadata-quality
  - First, to reduce warnings on non-SPDX licenses like "Copyrighted; all rights reserved" and "Other" since they are very common for us and I'm sick of seeing the warnings
  - Second, to skip whitespace and newline fixes on the abstract field since so many times they are intended

## 2023-02-08

- Make some edits to IFPRI records requested by Jawoo and Leigh
- Help Alessandra upload a last minute report for SAPLING
- Proof and upload twenty-seven IFPRI records to CGSpace
  - It's a good thing I did a duplicate check because I found three duplicates!
- Export CGSpace to update Initiative mappings and country/region mappings
  - Then start a harvest on AReS

## 2023-02-09

- Do some minor work on the CSS on the DSpace 7 test

## 2023-02-10

- I noticed a large number of PostgreSQL locks from dspaceWeb on CGSpace:

```console
$ psql -c 'SELECT * FROM pg_locks pl LEFT JOIN pg_stat_activity psa ON pl.pid = psa.pid;' | grep -o -E '(dspaceWeb|dspaceApi|dspaceCli)' | sort | uniq -c
   2033 dspaceWeb
```

- Looking at the lock age, I see some already 1 day old, including this curious query:

```console
select nextval ('public.registrationdata_seq')
```

- I killed all locks that were more than a few hours old
- Export CGSpace to update Initiative collection mappings
- Discuss adding `dcterms.available` to the submission form
  - I also looked in the `dcterms.description` field on CGSpace and found ~1,500 items where the is an indication of an online published date
  - Using some facets in OpenRefine I narrowed down the ones mentioning "online" and then extracted the dates to a new column:

```console
cells['dcterms.description[en_US]'].value.replace(/.*?(\d+{2}) ([a-zA-Z]+) (\d+{2}).*/,"$3-$2-$1")
```

- Then to handle formats like "2022-April-26" and "2021-Nov-11" I used some replacement GRELs (note the order so we don't replace short patterns in longer strings prematurely):

```console
value.replace("January","01").replace("February","02").replace("March","03").replace("April","04").replace("May","05").replace("June","06").replace("July","07").replace("August","08").replace("September","09").replace("October","10").replace("November","11").replace("December","12")
value.replace("Jan","01").replace("Feb","02").replace("Mar","03").replace("Apr","04").replace("May","05").replace("Jun","06").replace("Jul","07").replace("Aug","08").replace("Sep","09").replace("Oct","10").replace("Nov","11").replace("Dec","12")
```

- This covered about 1,300 items, then I did about 100 more messier ones with some more regex wranling
  - I removed the `dcterms.description[en_US]` field from items where I updated the dates
- Then I added `dcterms.available` to the submission form and the item view
  - We need to announce this to the editors

## 2023-02-13

- Export CGSpace to do some metadata quality checks
  - I added CGIAR Trust Fund as a donor to some new Initiative outputs
  - I moved some abstracts from the description field
  - I moved some version information to the `cg.edition` field

## 2023-02-14

- The PRMS team in Colombia sent some questions about countries on CGSpace
  - I had to fix some, that were clearly wrong, but there is also a difference between CGSpace and MEL because we use mostly iso-codes, and MEL uses the UN M.49 list
  - Then I re-ran the country code tagger from cgspace-java-helpers, forcing the update on all items in the Initiatives community
- Remove Alliance research levers from `cg.contributor.crp` field after discussing with Daniel and Maria
  - This was a mistake on TIP's part, and there is no direct mapping between research levers and CRPs
- I exported CGSpace to check Initiative collection mappings, regions, and licenses
  - Peter told me that all CGIAR blog posts for the Initiatives should be CC-BY-4.0, and I see the logo at the bottom in light gray!
  - I had previously missed that and removed some licenses for blog posts
  - I checked cgiar.org, ifpri.org, icarda.org, iwmi.cgiar.org, irri.org, etc and corrected a handful
- Start a harvest on AReS

## 2023-02-15

- Work on rebasing my local DSpace 7 dev branches on top of the latest 7.5-SNAPSHOT
  - It seems the issues I had with the `dspace submission-forms-migrate` tool in [August, 2022]({{< relref "2022-08.md" >}}) were fixed
- I imported a fresh PostgreSQL snapshot from CGSpace and then removed the Atmire migrations and ran the new migrations as I originally noted in [March, 2022]({{< relref "2022-03.md" >}}), and is pointed out in the [DSpace 7 upgrade notes](https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/DSDOC7x/Upgrading+DSpace)
  - Now I get a new error:

```console
localhost/dspace7= ☘ DELETE FROM schema_version WHERE version IN ('5.0.2017.09.25', '6.0.2017.01.30', '6.0.2017.09.25');
localhost/dspace7= ☘ DELETE FROM schema_version WHERE description LIKE '%Atmire%' OR description LIKE '%CUA%' OR description LIKE '%cua%';
localhost/dspace7= \q
$ ./bin/dspace database migrate ignored

```

- I dropped that index and then the migration succeeded:

```console
localhost/dspace7= ☘ DROP INDEX resourcepolicy_action_idx;
localhost/dspace7= ☘ \q
$ ./bin/dspace database migrate ignored
Done.
```

- I think that particular error is because I applied the [indexes in this unmerged DSpace 6 patch](https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/1792), so I don't need to report this as an error in DSpace 7

## 2023-02-16

- I found a suspicious number of PostgreSQL locks on CGSpace and decided to investigate:

```console
$ psql -c 'SELECT * FROM pg_locks pl LEFT JOIN pg_stat_activity psa ON pl.pid = psa.pid;' | grep -o -E '(dspaceWeb|dspaceApi|dspaceCli)' | sort | uniq -c
     44 dspaceApi
    372 dspaceCli
    446 dspaceWeb
```

- This started happening yesterday and I killed a few locks that were several hours old after inspecting the `locks-age.sql` output
- I also checked the `locks.sql` output, which helpfully lists the blocked PID and the blocking PID, to find one blocking PID that was idle in transaction
  - I killed that process and then all other locks were instantly processed
- I filed [a GitHub issue](https://github.com/DSpace/dspace-angular/issues/2103) on dspace-angular requesting the item view to use the bitstream description instead of the file name if present
- Weekly CG Core types meeting
  - I need to go through the actions and remove those items that are only for CGSpace internal use, ie:
    - CD-ROM
    - Manuscript-unpublished
    - Photo Report
    - Questionnaire
    - Wiki
- Weekly CGIAR Repository Working Group meeting
- I did some experiments with Crossref dates for about 20,000 DOIs in CGSpace using my `crossref-doi-lookup.py` script
- Some things I noted from reading the [Crossref API docs](https://github.com/CrossRef/rest-api-doc/blob/master/api_format.md) and inspecting the records for a few dozen DOIs manually:
  - `["created"]["date-parts"]` → Date on which the DOI was first registered (not useful for us)
  - `["published-print"]["date-parts"]` → Date on which the work was published in print
  - `["journal-issue"]["published-print"]["date-parts"]` → When present, is 99% the same as the above
  - `["published-online"]["date-parts"]` → Date on which the work was published online
  - `["journal-issue"]["published-online"]["date-parts"]` → Much more rare, and only 50% the same as the above, so unreliable
  - `["issued"]["date-parts"]` → Earliest of published-print and published-online (not useful to us)
- After checking the DOIs manully I decided that when the `published-print` date exists, it is usually more accurate than our issued dates
  - I set 12,300 issue dates to those from Crossref
- I also decided that, when `published-online` exists, it is usually accurate when I check the publisher page (we don't have many online dates to compare)
  - I set the available date for ~7,000 items to the published-online date as long as:
    - There was no `dcterms.available` date already
    - It was different than the issued date, because for now I only want online dates that are different, in case this is an online only journal in which case that can be the issue date... maybe I'll re-visit that later

## 2023-02-17

- It seems some (all?) of the changes I applied to dates last night didn't get saved...
  - I don't know what happened, so I will run them again after some investigation
  - I submitted the first batch of ~7,600 changes and it took twelve hours!
  - I almost cancelled it because after applying the changes there was a lock blocking everything for two hours, and it seemed to be stuck, but I kept checking it and saw that the `query_start` and `state_change` were being updated despite it being state "idle in transaction":

```console
$ psql -c 'SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE pid=1025176' | less -S
```

- I will apply the other changes in smaller batches...
- Lately I've noticed a lot of activity from the country code tagger curation task
  - Looking in the logs I see items being tagged that are very old and should have already been tagged years ago
  - Also, I see a ton of these errors whenever the task is updating an item:

```console

- This must be related...

## 2023-02-18

- I realized why the country-code-tagger was tagging everything: I had overridden the `force` parameter last week!
- Start a harvest on AReS

## 2023-02-20

- IWMI is concerned that some of their items with top Altmetric attention scores don't show up in the AReS Explorer
  - I looked into it for one and found that AReS is using the Handle, but Altmetric hasn't associated the Handle with the DOI
- Looking into country and region issues for the PRMS team
  - Last week they had some questions about some invalid countries that ended up being typos
  - I realized my cgspace-java-helpers country-code-tagger curation task is not using the latest version, so it was missing Türkiye
  - I compiled the new version and ran it manually, but I have to upload a new version to Maven Central and then update the dependency in `dspace/modules/additions/pom.xml` ughhhhhh
  - I tagged version 6.2 with the change for Türkiye and uploaded to to Maven Central with `mvn clean deploy`
- I'm having second thoughts about switching to UN M.49 for countries because there are just too many tradeoffs
  - I want to find a way to keep our existing list, and codify some rules for it
  - There are several discussions related to the shortcomings of ISO themselves and the iso-codes project, for example:
    - [Inconsistency with articles in ISO-3166-1 English short names](https://salsa.debian.org/iso-codes-team/iso-codes/-/issues/33) (this one was filed by me two years ago!)
    - [ISO 3166-1: What's the policy for `common_name`?](https://salsa.debian.org/iso-codes-team/iso-codes/-/issues/44)
  - I almost want to say fuck it, let's just use iso-codes and tell everyone to deal with it, but make sure we handle ISO 3166-1 Alpha2 or probably Alpha3 in the future
  - Something like:
    - Prefer `common_name` if it exists
    - Prefer the shorter of `name` and `official name`

## 2023-02-21

- Continue working on my `parse-iso-codes.py` script to parse the iso-codes JSON for ISO 3166-1
  - I also started a spreadsheet to track current CGSpace country names, proposed new names using the compromise above, and UN M.49 names
  - I proposed this to Peter but he wasn't happy because there are still some stupidly long and political names there
- I bumped the version of cgspace-java-helpers to 6.2-SNAPSHOT and pushed it to Maven Central because I can't figure out how to get non-snapshot releases to go there
- Ouch, grunt 1.6.0 was released a few weeks ago, which relies on Node.js v16, thus breaking the Mirage 2 build in DSpace 6
  - I filed [an issue in DSpace](https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/issues/8676)
- Help Moises from CIP troubleshoot harvesting issues on their WordPress site
  - I see 2,000 requests with the user agent "RTB website BOT" today and they are all HTTP 200

```console
# grep 'RTB website BOT' /var/log/nginx/rest.log | awk '{print $9}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -h
   2023 200
```
