## 2020-01-06

- Open [a ticket](https://tracker.atmire.com/tickets-cgiar-ilri/view-ticket?id=706) with Atmire to request a quote for the upgrade to DSpace 6
- Last week Altmetric responded about the [item](https://hdl.handle.net/10568/97087) that had a lower score than than its DOI
  - The score is now linked to the DOI
  - Another [item](https://handle.hdl.net/10568/91278) that had the same problem in 2019 has now also linked to the score for its DOI
  - Another [item](https://hdl.handle.net/10568/81236) that had the same problem in 2019 has also been fixed

## 2020-01-07

- Peter Ballantyne highlighted one more WLE [item](https://hdl.handle.net/10568/101286) that is missing the Altmetric score that its DOI has
  - The DOI has a score of 259, but the Handle has no score at all
  - I [tweeted](https://twitter.com/mralanorth/status/1214471427157626881) the CGSpace repository link

## 2020-01-08

- Export a list of authors from CGSpace for Peter Ballantyne to look through and correct:

```
dspace=# \COPY (SELECT DISTINCT text_value as "dc.contributor.author", count(*) FROM metadatavalue WHERE resource_type_id = 2 AND metadata_field_id = 3 GROUP BY text_value ORDER BY count DESC) to /tmp/2020-01-08-authors.csv WITH CSV HEADER;
COPY 68790
```

- As I always have encoding issues with files Peter sends, I tried to convert it to some Windows encoding, but got an error:

```
$ iconv -f utf-8 -t windows-1252 /tmp/2020-01-08-authors.csv -o /tmp/2020-01-08-authors-windows.csv
iconv: illegal input sequence at position 104779
```

- According to [this trick](https://www.datafix.com.au/BASHing/2018-09-13.html) the troublesome character is on line 5227:

```
$ awk 'END {print NR": "$0}' /tmp/2020-01-08-authors-windows.csv                                   
5227: "Oue
$ sed -n '5227p' /tmp/2020-01-08-authors.csv | xxd -c1
00000000: 22  "
00000001: 4f  O
00000002: 75  u
00000003: 65  e
00000004: cc  .
00000005: 81  .
00000006: 64  d
00000007: 72  r
```

- ~~According to the blog post linked above the troublesome character is probably the "High Octect Preset" (81)~~, which vim identifies (using `ga` on the character) as:

```
<e>  101,  Hex 65,  Octal 145 < ́> 769, Hex 0301, Octal 1401
```

- If I understand the situation correctly it sounds like this means that the character is not actually encoded as UTF-8, so it's stored incorrectly in the database...
- Other encodings like `windows-1251` and `windows-1257` also fail on different characters like "ž" and "é" that _are_ legitimate UTF-8 characters
- Then there is the issue of Russian, Chinese, etc characters, which are simply not representable in any of those encodings
- I think the solution is to upload it to Google Docs, or just send it to him and deal with each case manually in the corrections he sends me
- Re-deploy DSpace Test (linode19) with a fresh snapshot of the CGSpace database and assetstore, and using the `5_x-prod` (no CG Core v2) branch

## 2020-01-14

- I checked the yearly Solr statistics sharding cron job that should have run on 2020-01 on CGSpace (linode18) and saw that there was an error
  - I manually ran it on the server as the DSpace user and it said "Moving: 51633080 into core statistics-2019"
  - After a few hours it died with the same error that I had seen in the log from the first run:

```
Exception: Read timed out
java.net.SocketTimeoutException: Read timed out
```

- I am not sure how I will fix that shard...
- I discovered a very interesting tool called [ftfy](https://github.com/LuminosoInsight/python-ftfy) that attempts to fix errors in UTF-8
  - I'm curious to start checking input files with this to see what it highlights
  - I ran it on the authors file from last week and it converted characters like those with Spanish accents from multi-byte sequences (I don't know what it's called?) to digraphs (é→é), which vim identifies as:
  - `<e>  101,  Hex 65,  Octal 145 < ́> 769, Hex 0301, Octal 1401`
  - `<é> 233, Hex 00e9, Oct 351, Digr e'`
- Ah hah! We need to be [normalizing characters into their canonical forms](https://withblue.ink/2019/03/11/why-you-need-to-normalize-unicode-strings.html)!
  - In Python 3.8 we can even [check if the string is normalized using the `unicodedata` library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unicodedata.html):

```
In [7]: unicodedata.is_normalized('NFC', 'é')
Out[7]: False

In [8]: unicodedata.is_normalized('NFC', 'é')
Out[8]: True
```

## 2020-01-15

- I added support for Unicode normalization to my [csv-metadata-quality](https://github.com/ilri/csv-metadata-quality) tool in [v0.4.0](https://github.com/ilri/csv-metadata-quality/releases/tag/v0.4.0)
- Generate ILRI and Bioversity subject lists for Elizabeth Arnaud from Bioversity:

```
dspace=# \COPY (SELECT DISTINCT text_value as "cg.subject.ilri", count(*) FROM metadatavalue WHERE resource_type_id = 2 AND metadata_field_id = 203 GROUP BY text_value ORDER BY count DESC) to /tmp/2020-01-15-ilri-subjects.csv WITH CSV HEADER;
COPY 144
dspace=# \COPY (SELECT DISTINCT text_value as "cg.subject.bioversity", count(*) FROM metadatavalue WHERE resource_type_id = 2 AND metadata_field_id = 120 GROUP BY text_value ORDER BY count DESC) to /tmp/2020-01-15-bioversity-subjects.csv WITH CSV HEADER;
COPY 1325
```

- She will be meeting with FAO and will look over the terms to see if they can add some to AGROVOC
- I noticed a few errors in the ILRI subjects so I fixed them locally and on CGSpace (linode18) using my `fix-metadata.py` script:

```
$ ./fix-metadata-values.py -i 2020-01-15-fix-8-ilri-subjects.csv -db dspace -u dspace -p 'fuuu' -f cg.subject.ilri -m 203 -t correct -d
```

## 2020-01-16

- Extract a list of CIAT subjects from CGSpace for Elizabeth Arnaud from Bioversity:

```
dspace=# \COPY (SELECT DISTINCT text_value as "cg.subject.ciat", count(*) FROM metadatavalue WHERE resource_type_id = 2 AND metadata_field_id = 122 GROUP BY text_value ORDER BY count DESC) to /tmp/2020-01-16-ciat-subjects.csv WITH CSV HEADER;
COPY 35
```

- Start examining the 175 IITA records that Bosede originally sent in October, 2019 (201907.xls)
  - We had delayed processing them because DSpace Test (linode19) was testing CG Core v2 implementation for the last few months
  - Sisay uploaded the records to DSpace Test as [IITA_201907_Jan13](https://dspacetest.cgiar.org/handle/10568/106567)
  - I started first with basic sanity checks using my csv-metadata-quality tool and found twenty-two items with extra whitespace, invalid multi-value separators, and duplicates, which means Sisay did not do any quality checking on the data
  - I corrected one invalid AGROVOC subject
  - Validate and normalize affiliations against our 2019-04 list using reconcile-csv and OpenRefine:
    - `$ lein run ~/src/git/DSpace/2019-04-08-affiliations.csv name id`
    - I always forget how to copy the reconciled values in OpenRefine, but you need to make a new column and populate it using this GREL: `if(cell.recon.matched, cell.recon.match.name, value)`

## 2020-01-20

- Last week Atmire sent a quotation for the DSpace 6 upgrade that I had requested a few weeks ago
  - I forwarded it to Peter et al for their comment
  - We decided that we should probably buy enough credits to cover the upgrade and have 100 remaining for future development
- Visit CodeObia to discuss the next phase of AReS development

## 2020-01-21

- Create two accounts on CGSpace for CTA users
- Marie-Angelique finally responded to some of the pull requests I made on the CG Core v2 repository last month:
  - Merged: [HTML syntax fixes](https://github.com/AgriculturalSemantics/cg-core/pull/16)
  - Merged: [Add LICENSE file](https://github.com/AgriculturalSemantics/cg-core/pull/17)
  - Merged: [Build main.css using npm build](https://github.com/AgriculturalSemantics/cg-core/pull/18)
  - Approved a [wider scope for `cg.peer-reviewed`](https://github.com/AgriculturalSemantics/cg-core/issues/14) (renaming the field and using non-boolean values), but there is more discussion needed
- I opened a new [pull request](https://github.com/AgriculturalSemantics/cg-core/pull/24) on the cg-core repository validate and fix the formatting of the HTML files
- Create more issues for OpenRXV:
  - Based on Peter's feedback on the [text for labels and tooltips](https://github.com/ilri/OpenRXV/issues/33)
  - Based on Peter's feedback for the [export icon](https://github.com/ilri/OpenRXV/issues/35)
  - Based on Peter's feedback for the [sort options](https://github.com/ilri/OpenRXV/issues/31)
  - Based on Abenet's feedback that [PDF and Word exports are not working](https://github.com/ilri/OpenRXV/issues/34)

## 2020-01-22

- I tried to create a MaxMind account so I can download the GeoLite2-City database with a license key, but their server refuses to accept me:

```
Sorry, we were not able to create your account. Please ensure that you are using an email that is not disposable, and that you are not connecting via a proxy or VPN.
```

- They started [limiting public access to the database in December, 2019 due to GDPR and CCPA](https://blog.maxmind.com/2019/12/18/significant-changes-to-accessing-and-using-geolite2-databases/)
  - This will be a problem in the future (see [DS-4409](https://jira.lyrasis.org/browse/DS-4409))
- Peter sent me his corrections for the list of authors that I had sent him earlier in the month
  - There were encoding issues when I checked the file in vim and using Python-based tools, but OpenRefine was able to read and export it as UTF-8
  - I will apply them on CGSpace and DSpace Test using my `fix-metadata-values.py` script:

```
$ ./fix-metadata-values.py -i /tmp/2020-01-08-fix-2302-authors.csv -db dspace -u dspace -p 'fuuu' -f dc.contributor.author -m 3 -t correct -d
```

- Then I decided to export them again (with two author columns) so I can perform the new Unicode normalization mode I added to [csv-metadata-quality](https://github.com/ilri/csv-metadata-quality):

```
dspace=# \COPY (SELECT DISTINCT text_value as "dc.contributor.author", count(*) FROM metadatavalue WHERE resource_type_id = 2 AND metadata_field_id = 3 GROUP BY text_value ORDER BY count DESC) to /tmp/2020-01-22-authors.csv WITH CSV HEADER;
COPY 67314
dspace=# \q
$ csv-metadata-quality -i /tmp/2020-01-22-authors.csv -o /tmp/authors-normalized.csv -u --exclude-fields 'dc.date.issued,dc.date.issued[],dc.contributor.author'
$ ./fix-metadata-values.py -i /tmp/authors-normalized.csv -db dspace -u dspace -p 'fuuu' -f dc.contributor.author -m 3 -t correct
```

- Peter asked me to send him a list of affiliations to correct
  - First I decided to export them and run the Unicode normalizations and syntax checks with csv-metadata-quality and re-import the cleaned up values:

```
dspace=# \COPY (SELECT DISTINCT text_value as "cg.contributor.affiliation", text_value as "correct", count(*) FROM metadatavalue WHERE resource_type_id = 2 AND metadata_field_id = 211 GROUP BY text_value ORDER BY count DESC) to /tmp/2020-01-22-affiliations.csv WITH CSV HEADER;
COPY 6170
dspace=# \q
$ csv-metadata-quality -i /tmp/2020-01-22-affiliations.csv -o /tmp/affiliations-normalized.csv -u --exclude-fields 'dc.date.issued,dc.date.issued[],cg.contributor.affiliation'
$ ./fix-metadata-values.py -i /tmp/affiliations-normalized.csv -db dspace -u dspace -p 'fuuu' -f cg.contributor.affiliation -m 211 -t correct -n
```

- I applied the corrections on DSpace Test and CGSpace, and then scheduled a full Discovery reindex for later tonight:

```
$ sleep 4h && time schedtool -D -e ionice -c2 -n7 nice -n19 dspace index-discovery -b
```

- Then I generated a new list for Peter:

```
dspace=# \COPY (SELECT DISTINCT text_value as "cg.contributor.affiliation", count(*) FROM metadatavalue WHERE resource_type_id = 2 AND metadata_field_id = 211 GROUP BY text_value ORDER BY count DESC) to /tmp/2020-01-22-affiliations.csv WITH CSV HEADER;
COPY 6162
```

- Abenet said she noticed that she gets different results on AReS and Atmire Listing and Reports, for example with author "Hung, Nguyen"
  - I generated a report for 2019 and 2020 with each and I see there are indeed ten more Handles in the results from L&R:

```
$ in2csv AReS-1-801dd394-54b5-436c-ad09-4f2e25f7e62e.xlsx | sed -E 's/10568 ([0-9]+)/10568\/\1/' | csvcut -c Handle | grep -v Handle | sort -u > hung-nguyen-ares-handles.txt
$ grep -oE '10568\/[0-9]+' hung-nguyen-atmire.txt | sort -u > hung-nguyen-atmire-handles.txt
$ wc -l hung-nguyen-a*handles.txt
  46 hung-nguyen-ares-handles.txt
  56 hung-nguyen-atmire-handles.txt
 102 total
```

- Comparing the lists of items, I see that nine of the ten missing items were added less than twenty-four hours ago, and the other was added last week, so they apparently just haven't been indexed yet
  - I am curious to check tomorrow to see if they are there

## 2020-01-23

- I checked AReS and I see that there are now 55 items for author "Hung Nguyen-Viet" 
- Linode sent an alert that the outbound traffic rate of CGSpace (linode18) was high for several hours this morning around 5AM UTC+1
  - I checked the nginx logs this morning for the few hours before and after that using goaccess:

```
# cat /var/log/nginx/*.log /var/log/nginx/*.log.1 | grep -E "23/Jan/2020:0[12345678]" | goaccess --log-format=COMBINED -
```

- The top two hosts according to the amount of data transferred are:
  - 2a01:7e00::f03c:91ff:fe9a:3a37
  - 2a01:7e00::f03c:91ff:fe18:7396
- Both are on Linode, and appear to be the new and old ilri.org servers
 - I will ask the web team
  - Judging from the [ILRI publications site](https://www.ilri.org/publications/trade-offs-related-agricultural-use-antimicrobials-and-synergies-emanating-efforts) it seems they are downloading the PDFs so they can generate higher-quality thumbnails:
  - They are apparently using this Drupal module to generate the thumbnails: `sites/all/modules/contrib/pdf_to_imagefield`
  - I see some excellent suggestions in this [ImageMagick thread from 2012](https://www.imagemagick.org/discourse-server/viewtopic.php?t=21589) that lead me to some nice thumbnails (default PDF density is 72, so supersample to 4X and then resize back to 25%) as well as [this blog post](https://duncanlock.net/blog/2013/11/18/how-to-create-thumbnails-for-pdfs-with-imagemagick-on-linux/):

```
$ convert -density 288 -filter lagrange -thumbnail 25% -background white -alpha remove -sampling-factor 1:1 -colorspace sRGB 10568-97925.pdf\[0\] 10568-97925.jpg
```

- Here I'm also explicitly setting the background to white and removing any alpha layers, but I could probably also just keep using `-flatten` like DSpace already does
- I did some tests with a modified version of above that uses uses `-flatten` and drops the sampling-factor and colorspace, but bumps up the image size to 600px (default on CGSpace is currently 300):

```
$ convert -density 288 -filter lagrange -resize 25% -flatten 10568-97925.pdf\[0\] 10568-97925-d288-lagrange.pdf.jpg
$ convert -flatten 10568-97925.pdf\[0\] 10568-97925.pdf.jpg
$ convert -thumbnail x600 10568-97925-d288-lagrange.pdf.jpg 10568-97925-d288-lagrange-thumbnail.pdf.jpg
$ convert -thumbnail x600 10568-97925.pdf.jpg 10568-97925-thumbnail.pdf.jpg
```

- This emulate's DSpace's method of generating a high-quality image from the PDF and then creating a thumbnail
- I put together a proof of concept of this by adding the extra options to dspace-api's `ImageMagickThumbnailFilter.java` and it works
- I need to run tests on a handful of PDFs to see if there are any side effects
- The file size is about double the old ones, but the quality is very good and the file size is nowhere near ilri.org's 400KiB PNG!
- Peter sent me the corrections and deletions for affiliations last night so I imported them into OpenRefine to work around the normal UTF-8 issue, ran them through csv-metadata-quality to make sure all Unicode values were normalized (NFC), then applied them on DSpace Test and CGSpace:

```
$ csv-metadata-quality -i ~/Downloads/2020-01-22-fix-1113-affiliations.csv -o /tmp/2020-01-22-fix-1113-affiliations.csv -u --exclude-fields 'dc.date.issued,dc.date.issued[],cg.contributor.affiliation'
$ ./fix-metadata-values.py -i /tmp/2020-01-22-fix-1113-affiliations.csv -db dspace -u dspace -p 'fuuu' -f cg.contributor.affiliation -m 211 -t correct
$ ./delete-metadata-values.py -i /tmp/2020-01-22-delete-36-affiliations.csv -db dspace -u dspace -p 'fuuu' -f cg.contributor.affiliation -m 211
```

## 2020-01-26

- Add "Gender" to controlled vocabulary for CRPs ([#442](https://github.com/ilri/DSpace/pull/442))
- Deploy the changes on CGSpace and run all updates on the server and reboot it
  - I had to restart the `tomcat7` service several times until all Solr statistics cores came up OK
- I spent a few hours writing a script ([create-thumbnails](https://gist.github.com/alanorth/1c7c8b2131a19559e273fbc1e58d6a71)) to compare the default DSpace thumbnails with the improved parameters above and actually when comparing them at size 600px I don't really notice much difference, other than the new ones have slightly crisper text
  - So that was a waste of time, though I think our 300px thumbnails are a bit small now
  - [Another thread on the ImageMagick forum](https://www.imagemagick.org/discourse-server/viewtopic.php?t=14561) mentions that you need to set the density, then read the image, then set the density again:

```
$ convert -density 288 10568-97925.pdf\[0\] -density 72 -filter lagrange -flatten 10568-97925-density.jpg
```

- One thing worth mentioning was this syntax for extracting bits from JSON in bash using `jq`:

```
$ RESPONSE=$(curl -s 'https://dspacetest.cgiar.org/rest/handle/10568/103447?expand=bitstreams')
$ echo $RESPONSE | jq '.bitstreams[] | select(.bundleName=="ORIGINAL") | .retrieveLink'
"/bitstreams/172559/retrieve"
```

## 2020-01-27

- Bizu has been having problems when she logs into CGSpace, she can't see the community list on the front page
  - This last happened for another user in [2016-11]({{< ref "2016-11.md" >}}), and it was related to the Tomcat `maxHttpHeaderSize` being too small because the user was in too many groups
  - I see that it is similar, with this message appearing in the DSpace log just after she logs in:

```
2020-01-27 06:02:23,681 ERROR org.dspace.app.xmlui.aspect.discovery.AbstractRecentSubmissionTransformer @ Caught SearchServiceException while retrieving recent submission for: home page

```

- Now this appears to be a Solr limit of some kind ("too many boolean clauses")
  - I changed the `maxBooleanClauses` for all Solr cores on DSpace Test from 1024 to 2048 and then she was able to see her communities...
  - I made a [pull request](https://github.com/ilri/DSpace/pull/443) and merged it to the `5_x-prod` branch and will deploy on CGSpace later tonight
  - I am curious if anyone on the dspace-tech mailing list has run into this, so I will try to send a message about this there when I get a chance

## 2020-01-28

- Generate a list of CIP subjects for Abenet:

```
dspace=# \COPY (SELECT DISTINCT text_value as "cg.subject.cip", count(*) FROM metadatavalue WHERE resource_type_id = 2 AND metadata_field_id = 127 GROUP BY text_value ORDER BY count DESC) to /tmp/2020-01-28-cip-subjects.csv WITH CSV HEADER;
COPY 77
```

- Start looking over the IITA records from earlier this month ([IITA_201907_Jan13](https://dspacetest.cgiar.org/handle/10568/106567))
  - Delete one duplicate, map one item from ILRI community
  - The following items are duplicates or something (there is not enough metadata to tell for sure):
    - https://dspacetest.cgiar.org/handle/10568/106682
    - https://dspacetest.cgiar.org/handle/10568/106653
    - https://dspacetest.cgiar.org/handle/10568/106694
  - This item doesn't exist in the journal, and Weed Science volume 55 was published in 2007, not 2003:
    - https://dspacetest.cgiar.org/handle/10568/106665
  - All items using `cg.journal.title` instead of `dc.source`
  - Several items were missing ISSN despite having a journal title
  - Many items were missing DOIs, abstracts, etc
  - I did some metadata enrichment by searching for the items and copying relevant data from journal pages
  - I asked Bosede to try to do the same for the rest of the journal articles

## 2020-01-29

- Normalize about 4,500 DOI, YouTube, and SlideShare links on CGSpace that are missing HTTPS or using old format:

```
UPDATE metadatavalue SET text_value = regexp_replace(text_value, 'http://www.doi.org', 'https://doi.org') WHERE resource_type_id = 2 AND metadata_field_id = 220 AND text_value LIKE 'http://www.doi.org%';

- I exported a list of all of our ISSNs with item IDs so that I could fix them in OpenRefine and submit them with multi-value separators to DSpace metadata import:

```
dspace=# \COPY (SELECT resource_id as "id", text_value as "dc.identifier.issn" FROM metadatavalue WHERE resource_type_id = 2 AND metadata_field_id = 21) to /tmp/2020-01-29-issn.csv WITH CSV HEADER;
COPY 23339
```

- Then, after spending two hours correcting 1,000 ISSNs I realized that I need to normalize the `text_lang` fields in the database first or else these will all look like changes due to the "en_US" and NULL, etc (for both ISSN and ISBN):

```
dspace=# UPDATE metadatavalue SET text_lang='en_US' WHERE resource_type_id = 2 AND metadata_field_id IN (20,21);
UPDATE 30454
```

- Then I realized that my initial PostgreSQL query wasn't so genius because if a field already has multiple values it will appear on separate lines with the same ID, so when `dspace metadata-import` sees it, the change will be removed and added, or added and removed, depending on the order it is seen!
- A better course of action is to select the distinct ones and then correct them using `fix-metadata-values.py`...

```
dspace=# \COPY (SELECT DISTINCT text_value as "dc.identifier.issn[en_US]", count(*) FROM metadatavalue WHERE resource_type_id = 2 AND metadata_field_id = 21 GROUP BY text_value ORDER BY count DESC) to /tmp/2020-01-29-issn-distinct.csv WITH CSV HEADER;
COPY 2900
```

- I re-applied all my corrections, filtering out things like multi-value separators and values that are actually ISBNs so I can fix them later
- Then I applied 181 fixes for ISSNs using `fix-metadata-values.py` on DSpace Test and CGSpace (after testing locally):

```
$ ./fix-metadata-values.py -i /tmp/2020-01-29-ISSNs-Distinct.csv -db dspace -u dspace -p 'fuuu' -f 'dc.identifier.issn[en_US]' -m 21 -t correct -d
```

- It's annoying that we have to target DSpace 6.3... I think I should totally cherry-pick these when I'm done
- For now I just created a new DSpace repository and checked out the `dspace-6.3` tag and started diffing and copying changes over from our 5.8 repository
- There are some things I need to remember to check:
  - `search.index` settings in DSpace 5's dspace.cfg (dunno where they are now)
  - `thumbnail-fallback-files.xml`
- The code currently lives in the `6_x-dev` branch
