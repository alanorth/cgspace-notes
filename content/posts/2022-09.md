## 2022-09-01

- A bit of work on the "Mapping CG Core–CGSpace–MEL–MARLO Types" spreadsheet
- I tested an item submission on DSpace Test with the Cocoon `org.apache.cocoon.uploads.autosave=false` change
  - The submission works as expected
- Start debugging some region-related issues with csv-metadata-quality
  - I created a new test file `test-geography.csv` with some different scenarios
  - I also fixed a few bugs and improved the region-matching logic

- I filed [an issue for the "South-eastern Asia" case mismatch in country_converter](https://github.com/konstantinstadler/country_converter/issues/115) on GitHub
- Meeting with Moayad to discuss OpenRXV developments
  - He demoed his new multiple dashboards feature and I helped him rebase those changes to master so we can test them more

## 2022-09-02

- I worked a bit more on exclusion and skipping logic in csv-metadata-quality
  - I also pruned and updated all the Python dependencies
  - Then I released [version 0.6.0](https://github.com/ilri/csv-metadata-quality/releases/tag/v0.6.0) now that the excludes and region matching support is working way better
