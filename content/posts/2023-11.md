- Work a bit on the ETL pipeline for the CGIAR Climate Change Synthesis
  - I improved the filtering and wrote some Python using pandas to merge my sources more reliably

- Export CGSpace to check missing Initiative collection mappings
- Start a harvest on AReS

- IFPRI contacted us about importing their Slideshare presentations to CGSpace
  - There are ~1,700 of them and date back to as early as 2008
  - I did a quick cleanup of the metadata export from Slideshare (including tagging with some AGROVOC in OpenRefine) and uploaded to DSpace Test
