- I figured out how to use Altmetric and Dimensions badges in the DSpace Angular frontend
  - It still feels hacky, but using [AfterViewInit](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41936631/how-to-trigger-the-function-after-dom-markup-is-loaded-in-angular-style-applicat), and importing the Altmetric `embed.js` in the component works
  - The style on mobile also needs work...

- Discussion with Marie about finalizing the output types list on GitHub
  - I did some review and cleanup in preparation for publishing the new list

## 2023-09-07

- Export CGSpace to start doing a review of the metadata
- First I will start by extracting all items with DOIs, along with some fields I can compare against Crossref:

```console
$ csvgrep -c 'cg.identifier.doi[en_US]' -r 'doi.org' ~/Downloads/2023-09-07-cgspace.csv \
    | csvcut -c 'id,dc.title[en_US],dcterms.issued[en_US],dcterms.available[en_US],cg.issn[en_US],cg.isbn[en_US],cg.volume[en_US],cg.issue[en_US],cg.number[en_US],dcterms.extent[en_US],cg.identifier.doi[en_US],cg.reviewStatus[en_US],cg.isijournal[en_US],dcterms.license[en_US],dcterms.accessRights[en_US],dcterms.type[en_US],dc.identifier.uri[en_US]' \
    > /tmp/2023-09-07-cgspace-dois.csv
$ csvgrep -c 'cg.identifier.doi[en_US]' -r 'doi.org' ~/Downloads/2023-09-07-cgspace.csv | csvcut -c 'cg.identifier.doi[en_US]' | sed 1d > /tmp/2023-09-07-cgspace-dois.txt
```

- Then I resolved the DOIs from Crossref:

```console
$ ./ilri/crossref_doi_lookup.py -i /tmp/2023-09-07-cgspace-dois.txt -o /tmp/2023-09-07-cgspace-dois-results.csv -e a.orth@cgiar.org
```

- A user emailed to ask about uploading a 180MB PDF to CGSpace
  - I used GhostScript to try reducing it using the `screen`, `ebook` and `prepress` presets:

```console
$ gs -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dCompatibilityLevel=1.4 -dPDFSETTINGS=/screen -dNOPAUSE -dQUIET -dBATCH -sOutputFile=primer-screen.pdf Primer\ \(digital\)_Climate-\ smart\ and\ regenerative\ agriculture\ in\ climate\ change\ adaptation.pdf 
$ gs -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dCompatibilityLevel=1.4 -dPDFSETTINGS=/ebook -dNOPAUSE -dQUIET -dBATCH -sOutputFile=primer-ebook.pdf Primer\ \(digital\)_Climate-\ smart\ and\ regenerative\ agriculture\ in\ climate\ change\ adaptation.pdf
$ gs -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dCompatibilityLevel=1.4 -dPDFSETTINGS=/prepress -dNOPAUSE -dQUIET -dBATCH -sOutputFile=primer-prepress.pdf Primer\ \(digital\)_Climate-\ smart\ and\ regenerative\ agriculture\ in\ climate\ change\ adaptation.pdf
```

- The `prepress` one is 300DPI and looks visually identical to the original, so I proposed that we use that one

## 2023-09-08

- I did a review of the metadata for our items with DOIs, comparing with data from Crossref
  - I spot checked a handful of issue / online dates and licenses, and saw that Crossref's dates are always more accurate than ours when they differ
  - I also filled in some missing volumes, issues, ISSNs, and extents
  - This results in 14,000 changes to existing items, which will take several days to import unfortunately
  - After eight hours the first file is only about 2/3 finished... sigh
- Meet with Peter to discuss changes to the DSpace 7 test
  - Minor updates to submission forms and some new ideas for the home page and item page
- I figured out how to use a themed home page component and add a cards UI to our CGSpace theme

## 2023-09-09

- I can't believe that almost 18 hours later the first CSV import with 5,000 changes is not done...
- Run all system updates on CGSpace and reboot it, as it had been two months since the last time

## 2023-09-10

- Minor work on the DSpace 7 home page

## 2023-09-11

- Export CGSpace to check for missing Initiative collection mappings
- Start a harvest on AReS

## 2023-09-12

- Minor work on DSpace 7 home page
- Minor work on CG Core types
  - I published a new HTML version of the updated IPtypes and archived the current version as v2.0.0 so we can still reference it

## 2023-09-13

- Stefano reminded me about the updated OAI MODS mappings on CGSpace so I re-applied them on DSpace Test and updated the OAI index so he could confirm
  - Now I'm ready to put it on CGSpace if he confirms
- I created a basic theme for CIP on DSpace 7
  - While doing that I noticed that a bunch of CIP bitstreams didn't have the latest 500px thumbnails so I re-ran filter-media on a handful of their collections
- I had two occurrences of an OOM kill of the Tomcat 9 java process on DSpace 7 test tonight
  - Once while doing a Discovery index, the other while doing filter media
