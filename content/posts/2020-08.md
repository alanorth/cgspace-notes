## 2020-08-02

- I spent a few days working on a Java-based curation task to tag items with ISO 3166-1 Alpha2 country codes based on their `cg.coverage.country` text values
  - It looks up the names in ISO 3166-1 first, and then in our CGSpace countries mapping (which has five or so of Peter's preferred "display" country names)
  - It implements a "force" mode too that will clear existing country codes and re-tag everything
  - It is class based so I can easily add support for other vocabularies, and the technique could even be used for organizations with mappings to ROR and Clarisa...

- The code is currently on my personal GitHub: https://github.com/alanorth/dspace-curation-tasks
  - I still need to figure out how to integrate this with the DSpace build because currently you have to package it and copy the JAR to the `dspace/lib` directory (not to mention the config)
- I forked the [dspace-curation-tasks to ILRI's GitHub](https://github.com/ilri/dspace-curation-tasks) and [submitted the project to Maven Central](https://issues.sonatype.org/browse/OSSRH-59650) so I can integrate it more easily with our DSpace build via dependencies
