## 2018-10-01

- Phil Thornton got an ORCID identifier so we need to add it to the list on CGSpace and tag his existing items
- I created a GitHub issue to track this [#389](https://github.com/ilri/DSpace/issues/389), because I'm super busy in Nairobi right now

## 2018-10-03

- I see Moayad was busy collecting item views and downloads from CGSpace yesterday:

```
# zcat --force /var/log/nginx/*.log /var/log/nginx/*.log.1 | grep -E "02/Oct/2018" | awk '{print $1}
' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 10
    933 40.77.167.90
    971 95.108.181.88
   1043 41.204.190.40
   1454 157.55.39.54
   1538 207.46.13.69
   1719 66.249.64.61
   2048 50.116.102.77
   4639 66.249.64.59
   4736 35.237.175.180
 150362 34.218.226.147
```

- Of those, about 20% were HTTP 500 responses (!):

```
$ zcat --force /var/log/nginx/*.log /var/log/nginx/*.log.1 | grep -E "02/Oct/2018" | grep 34.218.226.147 | awk '{print $9}' | sort -n | uniq -c
 118927 200
  31435 500
```
