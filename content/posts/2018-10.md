## 2018-10-01

- Phil Thornton got an ORCID identifier so we need to add it to the list on CGSpace and tag his existing items
- I created a GitHub issue to track this [#389](https://github.com/ilri/DSpace/issues/389), because I'm super busy in Nairobi right now

## 2018-10-03

- I see Moayad was busy collecting item views and downloads from CGSpace yesterday:

```
# zcat --force /var/log/nginx/*.log /var/log/nginx/*.log.1 | grep -E "02/Oct/2018" | awk '{print $1}
' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 10
    933 40.77.167.90
    971 95.108.181.88
   1043 41.204.190.40
   1454 157.55.39.54
   1538 207.46.13.69
   1719 66.249.64.61
   2048 50.116.102.77
   4639 66.249.64.59
   4736 35.237.175.180
 150362 34.218.226.147
```

- Of those, about 20% were HTTP 500 responses (!):

```
$ zcat --force /var/log/nginx/*.log /var/log/nginx/*.log.1 | grep -E "02/Oct/2018" | grep 34.218.226.147 | awk '{print $9}' | sort -n | uniq -c
 118927 200
  31435 500
```

- I added Phil Thornton and Sonal Henson's ORCID identifiers to the controlled vocabulary for `cg.creator.orcid` and then re-generated the names using my [resolve-orcids.py](https://gist.github.com/alanorth/57a88379126d844563c1410bd7b8d12b) script:

```
$ grep -oE '[A-Z0-9]{4}-[A-Z0-9]{4}-[A-Z0-9]{4}-[A-Z0-9]{4}' ~/src/git/DSpace/dspace/config/controlled-vocabularies/cg-creator-id.xml | sort | uniq > 2018-10-03-orcids.txt
$ ./resolve-orcids.py -i 2018-10-03-orcids.txt -o 2018-10-03-names.txt -d
```

- I found a new corner case error that I need to check, given *and* family names deactivated:

```
Looking up the names associated with ORCID iD: 0000-0001-7930-5752
Given Names Deactivated Family Name Deactivated: 0000-0001-7930-5752
```

- It appears to be Jim Lorenzen... I need to check that later!
- I merged the changes to the `5_x-prod` branch ([#390](https://github.com/ilri/DSpace/pull/390))
