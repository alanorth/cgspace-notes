## 2018-07-01

- Test the DSpace 5.8 upgrade on DSpace Test
- First take a backup of the current database:

```
$ pg_dump -b -v -o --format=custom -U dspace -f dspace-2018-07-01.backup dspace
```

- During the `mvn package` stage I kept getting issues with java running out of memory:

```
There is insufficient memory for the Java Runtime Environment to continue.
```

- So I reduced the Tomcat memory heap from 5120m to 4096m so I could try to allocate more to the build process (machine only has 8GB of RAM):

```
$ export JAVA_OPTS="-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -Xmx1024m"
$ mvn package...
```
