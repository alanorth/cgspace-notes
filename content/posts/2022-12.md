## 2022-12-01

- Fix some incorrect regions on CGSpace
  - I exported the CCAFS and IITA communities, extracted just the country and region columns, then ran them through csv-metadata-quality to fix the regions
- Add a few more authors to my CSV with author names and ORCID identifiers and tag 283 items!
- Replace "East Asia" with "Eastern Asia" region on CGSpace (UN M.49 region)

<!--more-->

- CGSpace and PRMS information session with Enrico and a bunch of researchers
- I noticed some minor issues with SPDX licenses and AGROVOC terms in items submitted by TIP so I sent a message to Daniel from Alliance
- I startd a harvest on AReS since we've updated so much metadata recently
