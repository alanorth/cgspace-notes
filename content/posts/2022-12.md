## 2022-12-01

- Fix some incorrect regions on CGSpace
  - I exported the CCAFS and IITA communities, extracted just the country and region columns, then ran them through csv-metadata-quality to fix the regions
- Add a few more authors to my CSV with author names and ORCID identifiers and tag 283 items!
- Replace "East Asia" with "Eastern Asia" region on CGSpace (UN M.49 region)

- CGSpace and PRMS information session with Enrico and a bunch of researchers
- I noticed some minor issues with SPDX licenses and AGROVOC terms in items submitted by TIP so I sent a message to Daniel from Alliance
- I startd a harvest on AReS since we've updated so much metadata recently

## 2022-12-02

- File some issues related to metadata on the MEL issue tracker
  - [Only use "Open Access" or "Limited Access" access rights when publishing items on CGSpace](https://github.com/CodeObia/MEL/issues/11066)
  - [Set the description when submitting bitstreams to CGSpace](https://github.com/CodeObia/MEL/issues/11067)
  - [Some items have a Creative Commons license, but are Limited Access and bitstreams are locked](https://github.com/CodeObia/MEL/issues/11068)

## 2022-12-03

- I downloaded a fresh copy of CLARISA's institutions list as well as ROR's latest dump from 2022-12-01 to check how many are matching:

```console
$ curl -s https://api.clarisa.cgiar.org/api/institutions | json_pp > ~/Downloads/2022-12-03-CLARISA-institutions.json
$ jq -r '.[] | .name' ~/Downloads/2022-12-03-CLARISA-institutions.json > ~/Downloads/2022-12-03-CLARISA-institutions.txt
$ ./ilri/ror-lookup.py -i ~/Downloads/2022-12-03-CLARISA-institutions.txt -o /tmp/clarisa-ror-matches.csv -r v1.15-2022-12-01-ror-data.json
$ csvgrep -c matched -m true /tmp/clarisa-ror-matches.csv | wc -l
1864
$ wc -l ~/Downloads/2022-12-03-CLARISA-institutions.txt
7060 /home/aorth/Downloads/2022-12-03-CLARISA-institutions.txt
```

- Out of the box they match 26.4%, but there are many institutions with multiple languages in the text value, as well as countries in parentheses so I think it could be higher
- If I replace the slashes and remove the countries at the end there are slightly more matches, around 29%:

```console
$ sed -e 's_ / _\n_' -e 's_/_\n_' -e 's/ \?(.*)$//' ~/Downloads/2022-12-03-CLARISA-institutions.txt > ~/Downloads/2022-12-03-CLARISA-institutions-alan.txt
```

- I checked CGSpace's top 1,000 affiliations too, first exporting from PostgreSQL:

```console
localhost/dspacetest= ☘ \COPY (SELECT DISTINCT text_value as "cg.contributor.affiliation", count(*) FROM metadatavalue WHERE dspace_object_id IN (SELECT uuid FROM item) AND metadata_field_id = 211 GROUP BY text_value ORDER BY count DESC LIMIT 1000) to /tmp/2022-11-22-affiliations.csv;
```

- Then cutting (tab is the default delimeter):

```console
$ cut -f 1 /tmp/2022-11-22-affiliations.csv > 2022-11-22-affiliations.txt
$ ./ilri/ror-lookup.py -i 2022-11-22-affiliations.txt -o /tmp/cgspace-matches.csv -r v1.15-2022-12-01-ror-data.json
$ csvgrep -c matched -m true /tmp/cgspace-matches.csv | wc -l
542
```

- So that's a 54% match for our top affiliations
- I realized we should actually check affiliations and sponsors, since those are stored in separate fields
  - When I add those the matches go down a bit to 45%
- Oh man, I realized institutions like `Université d'Abomey Calavi` don't match in ROR because they are like this in the JSON:

```console
"name": "Universit\u00e9 d'Abomey-Calavi"
```

- So we likely match a bunch more than 50%...
- I exported a list of affiliations and donors from CGSpace for Peter to look over and send corrections

## 2022-12-05

- First day of PRMS technical workshop in Rome
- Last night I submitted a CSV import with changes to 1,500 Alliance items (adding regions) and it hadn't completed after twenty-four hours so I canceled it
  - Not sure if there is some rollback that will happen or what state the database will be in, so I will wait a few hours to see what happens before trying to modify those items again
  - I started it again a few hours later with a subset of the items and 4GB of RAM instead of 2
  - It completed successfully...

## 2022-12-07

- I found a bug in my csv-metadata-quality script regarding the regions
  - I was accidentally checking `cg.coverage.subregion` due to a sloppy regex
  - This means I've added a few thousand UN M.49 regions to the `cg.coverage.subregion` field in the last few days
  - I had to extract them from CGSpace and delete them using `delete-metadata-values.py`
- My [DSpace 7.x pull request to tell ImageMagick about the PDF CropBox](https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/8550) was merged
- Start a harvest on AReS

## 2022-12-08

- While on the plane I decided to fix some ORCID identifiers, as I had seen some poorly formatted ones
  - I couldn't remember the XPath syntax so this was kinda ghetto:

```console
$ xmllint --xpath '//node/isComposedBy/node()' dspace/config/controlled-vocabularies/cg-creator-identifier.xml | grep -oE 'label=".*"' | sed -e 's/label="//' -e 's/"$//' > /tmp/orcid-names.txt
$ ./ilri/update-orcids.py -i /tmp/orcid-names.txt -db dspace -u dspace -p 'fuuu' -m 247
```

- After that there were still some poorly formatted ones that my script didn't fix, so perhaps these are new ones not in our list
  - I dumped them and combined with the existing ones to resolve later:

```console
localhost/dspace= ☘ \COPY (SELECT dspace_object_id,text_value FROM metadatavalue WHERE metadata_field_id=247 AND text_value LIKE '%http%') to /tmp/orcid-formatting.txt;
COPY 36
```

- I think there are really just some new ones...

```console
$ cat ~/src/git/DSpace/dspace/config/controlled-vocabularies/cg-creator-identifier.xml /tmp/orcid-formatting.txt| grep -oE '[A-Z0-9]{4}-[A-Z0-9]{4}-[A-Z0-9]{4}-[A-Z0-9]{4}' | sort -u > /tmp/2022-12-08-orcids.txt 
$ cat ~/src/git/DSpace/dspace/config/controlled-vocabularies/cg-creator-identifier.xml | grep -oE '[A-Z0-9]{4}-[A-Z0-9]{4}-[A-Z0-9]{4}-[A-Z0-9]{4}' | sort -u | wc -l
1907
$ wc -l /tmp/2022-12-08-orcids.txt
1939 /tmp/2022-12-08-orcids.txt
```

- Then I applied these updates on CGSpace
- Maria mentioned that she was getting a lot more items in her daily subscription emails
  - I had a hunch it was related to me updating the `last_modified` timestamp after updating a bunch of countries, regions, etc in items
  - Then today I noticed this option in `dspace.cfg`: `eperson.subscription.onlynew`
  - By default DSpace sends notifications for modified items too! I've disabled it now...
- I applied 498 fixes and two deletions to affiliations sent by Peter
- I applied 206 fixes and eighty-one deletions to donors sent by Peter
- I tried to figure out how to authenticate to the DSpace 7 REST API
  - First [you need a CSRF token](https://github.com/DSpace/RestContract/blob/main/csrf-tokens.md), before you can even try to authenticate
  - Then you can authenticate, but I can't get it to work:

```console
$ curl -v https://dspace7test.ilri.org/server/api
...
dspace-xsrf-token: 0b7861fb-9c8a-4eea-be70-b3be3bd0a0b4
...
$ curl -v -X POST --data "user=aorth@omg.com&password=myPassword" "https://dspace7test.ilri.org/server/authn/login" -H "X-XSRF-TOKEN: 0b7861fb-9c8a-4eea-be70-b3be3bd0a0b4"
```

## 2022-12-09

- I found a way to check the owner of a Handle prefix
  - You query the admin Handle for the prefix, ie: https://hdl.handle.net/0.na/10568

## 2022-12-11

- I got LDAP authentication working on DSpace 7

## 2022-12-12
