## 2018-06-04

- Test the [DSpace 5.8 module upgrades from Atmire](https://tracker.atmire.com/tickets-cgiar-ilri/view-ticket?id=560) ([#378](https://github.com/ilri/DSpace/pull/378))
  - There seems to be a problem with the CUA and L&R versions in `pom.xml` because they are using SNAPSHOT and it doesn't build
- I added the new CCAFS Phase II Project Tag `PII-FP1_PACCA2` and merged it into the `5_x-prod` branch ([#379](https://github.com/ilri/DSpace/pull/379))
- I proofed and tested the ILRI author corrections that Peter sent back to me this week:

```
$ ./fix-metadata-values.py -i /tmp/2018-05-30-Correct-660-authors.csv -db dspace -u dspace -p 'fuuu' -f dc.contributor.author -t correct -m 3 -n
```

- I think a sane proofing workflow in OpenRefine is to apply the custom text facets for check/delete/remove and illegal characters that I developed in [March, 2018]({{< relref "2018-03.md" >}})
- Time to index ~70,000 items on CGSpace:

```
$ time schedtool -D -e ionice -c2 -n7 nice -n19 [dspace]/bin/dspace index-discovery -b                                  

real    74m42.646s
user    8m5.056s
sys     2m7.289s
```
