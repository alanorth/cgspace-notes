## 2018-06-04

- Test the [DSpace 5.8 module upgrades from Atmire](https://tracker.atmire.com/tickets-cgiar-ilri/view-ticket?id=560) ([#378](https://github.com/ilri/DSpace/pull/378))
  - There seems to be a problem with the CUA and L&R versions in `pom.xml` because they are using SNAPSHOT and it doesn't build
- I added the new CCAFS Phase II Project Tag `PII-FP1_PACCA2` and merged it into the `5_x-prod` branch ([#379](https://github.com/ilri/DSpace/pull/379))
- I proofed and tested the ILRI author corrections that Peter sent back to me this week:

```
$ ./fix-metadata-values.py -i /tmp/2018-05-30-Correct-660-authors.csv -db dspace -u dspace -p 'fuuu' -f dc.contributor.author -t correct -m 3 -n
```

- I think a sane proofing workflow in OpenRefine is to apply the custom text facets for check/delete/remove and illegal characters that I developed in [March, 2018]({{< relref "2018-03.md" >}})
- Time to index ~70,000 items on CGSpace:

```
$ time schedtool -D -e ionice -c2 -n7 nice -n19 [dspace]/bin/dspace index-discovery -b                                  

real    74m42.646s
user    8m5.056s
sys     2m7.289s
```

- It turns out that I needed to add a server block for `atmire.com-snapshots` to my Maven settings, so now the Atmire code builds
- Now Maven and Ant run properly, but I'm getting SQL migration errors in `dspace.log` after starting Tomcat
- I've updated my ticket on Atmire's bug tracker: https://tracker.atmire.com/tickets-cgiar-ilri/view-ticket?id=560

## 2018-06-07

- Proofing 200 IITA records on DSpace Test for Sisay: [IITA_Junel_06 (10568/95391)](https://dspacetest.cgiar.org/handle/10568/95391)
  - Mispelled authorship type: CGAIR single center should be: CGIAR single centre
  - I see some encoding errors in author affiliations, for example:
    - Universidade de SÆo Paulo
    - Institut National des Recherches Agricoles du B nin
    - Centre de Coop ration Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour le D veloppement
    - Institut des Recherches Agricoles du B nin
    - Institut des Savannes, C te d' Ivoire
    - Institut f r Pflanzenpathologie und Pflanzenschutz der Universit t, Germany
    - Projet de Gestion des Ressources Naturelles, B nin
    - Universit t Hannover
    - Universit F lix Houphouet-Boigny
- I uploaded fixes for all those now, but I will continue with the rest of the data later
- Regarding the SQL migration errors, Atmire told me I need to run some migrations manually in PostgreSQL:

```
delete from schema_version where version = '5.6.2015.12.03.2';
update schema_version set version = '5.6.2015.12.03.2' where version = '5.5.2015.12.03.2';
update schema_version set version = '5.8.2015.12.03.3' where version = '5.5.2015.12.03.3';
```

- And then I need to ignore the ignored ones:

```
$ ~/dspace/bin/dspace database migrate ignored
```

- Now DSpace starts up properly!
- Gabriela from CIP got back to me about the author names we were correcting on CGSpace
- I did a quick sanity check on them and then did a test import with my [`fix-metadata-value.py`](https://gist.github.com/alanorth/df92cbfb54d762ba21b28f7cd83b6897) script:

```
$ ./fix-metadata-values.py -i /tmp/2018-06-08-CIP-Authors.csv -db dspace -u dspace -p 'fuuu' -f dc.contributor.author -t correct -m 3
```

- I will apply them on CGSpace tomorrow I think...

## 2018-06-09

- It's pretty annoying, but the JVM monitoring for Munin was never set up when I migrated DSpace Test to its new server a few months ago
- I ran the tomcat and munin-node tags in Ansible again and now the stuff is all wired up and recording stats properly
- I applied the CIP author corrections on CGSpace and DSpace Test and re-ran the Discovery indexing

## 2018-06-10

- I spent some time removing the Atmire Metadata Quality Module (MQM) from the proposed DSpace 5.8 changes
- After removing all code mentioning MQM, mqm, metadata-quality, batchedit, duplicatechecker, etc, I think I got most of it removed, but there is a Spring error during Tomcat startup:

```
 INFO [org.dspace.servicemanager.DSpaceServiceManager] Shutdown DSpace core service manager
Failed to startup the DSpace Service Manager: failure starting up spring service manager: Error creating bean with name 'org.dspace.servicemanager.spring.DSpaceBeanPostProcessor#0' defined in class path resource [spring/spring-dspace-applicationContext.xml]: Unsatisfied dependency expressed through constructor argument with index 0 of type [org.dspace.servicemanager.config.DSpaceConfigurationService]: : Cannot find class [com.atmire.dspace.discovery.ItemCollectionPlugin] for bean with name 'itemCollectionPlugin' defined in file [/home/aorth/dspace/config/spring/api/discovery.xml];
```

- I can fix this by commenting out the `ItemCollectionPlugin` line of `discovery.xml`, but from looking at the git log I'm not actually sure if that is related to MQM or not
- I will have to ask Atmire
- I continued to look at Sisay's IITA records from last week
  - I normalized all DOIs to use HTTPS and "doi.org" instead of "dx.doi.org"
  - I cleaned up white space in `cg.subject.iita` and `dc.subject`
  - Even a bunch of IITA and AGROVOC subjects are missing accents, ie "FERTILIT DU SOL"
  - More organization names in `dc.description.sponsorship` are incorrect (ie, missing accents) or inconsistent (ie, CGIAR centers should be spelled in English or multiple spellings of the same one, like "Rockefeller Foundation" and "Rockefeller foundation")
  - A few dozen items have abstracts with character encoding errors, ie:
    - 33.7øC
    - MgSO4ú7H2O
    - ha??1&/sup;
    - En gen6ral
    - dÕpassÕ
  - Also the abstracts have missing accents, ie "recherche sur le d veloppement"
- I will have to tell IITA people to redo these entirely I think...

## 2018-06-11

- Sisay sent a new version of the last IITA records that he created from the original CSV from IITA
- The 200 records are in the [IITA_Junel_11 (10568/95870)](https://dspacetest.cgiar.org/handle/10568/95870) collection
- Many errors:
  - Authorship types: "CGIAR ans advanced research institute", "CGAIR and advanced research institute", "CGIAR and advanced research institutes", "CGAIR single center"
  - Lots of inconsistencies and mispellings in author affiliations:
    - "Institut des Recherches Agricoles du Bénin" and "Institut National des Recherche Agricoles du Benin" and "National Agricultural Research Institute, Benin"
    - International Insitute of Tropical Agriculture
    - Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical
    - "Rivers State University of Science and Technology" and "Rivers State University"
    - "Institut de la Recherche Agronomique, Cameroon" and "Institut de Recherche Agronomique, Cameroon"
  - Inconsistency in countries: "COTE D’IVOIRE" and "COTE D'IVOIRE"
  - A few DOIs with spaces or invalid characters
  - Inconsistency in IITA subjects, for example "PRODUCTION VEGETALE" and "PRODUCTION VÉGÉTALE" and several others
  - I ran `value.unescape('javascript')` on the abstract and citation fields because it looks like this data came from a SQL database and some stuff was escaped
- It turns out that Abenet actually did a lot of small corrections on this data so when Sisay uses Bosede's original file it doesn't have all those corrections
- So I told Sisay to re-create the collection using Abenet's XLS from last week (`Mercy1805_AY.xls`)
- I was curious to see if I could create a GREL for use with a custom text facet in Open Refine to find cells with two or more consecutive spaces
- I always use the built-in trim and collapse transformations anyways, but this seems to work to find the offending cells: `isNotNull(value.match(/.*?\s{2,}.*?/))`
- I wonder if I should start checking for "smart" quotes like ’ (hex 2019)

## 2018-06-12

- Udana from IWMI asked about the OAI base URL for their community on CGSpace
- I think it should be this: https://cgspace.cgiar.org/oai/request?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=oai_dc&set=com_10568_16814
- The style sheet obfuscates the data, but if you look at the source it is all there, including information about pagination of results
- Regarding Udana's Book Chapters and Reports on DSpace Test last week, Abenet told him to fix some character encoding and CRP issues, then I told him I'd check them after that
- The latest batch of IITA's 200 records (based on Abenet's version `Mercy1805_AY.xls`) are now in the [IITA_Jan_9_II_Ab](https://dspacetest.cgiar.org/handle/10568/96071) collection
- So here are some corrections:
  - use of Unicode smart quote (hex 2019) in countries and affiliations, for example "COTE D’IVOIRE" and "Institut d’Economic Rurale, Mali"
  - inconsistencies in `cg.contributor.affiliation`:
    - "Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical" and "Centro International de Agricultura Tropical" should use the English name of CIAT (International Center for Tropical Agriculture)
    - "Institut International d'Agriculture Tropicale" should use the English name of IITA (International Institute of Tropical Agriculture)
    - "East and Southern Africa Regional Center" and "Eastern and Southern Africa Regional Centre"
    - "Institut de la Recherche Agronomique, Cameroon" and "Institut de Recherche Agronomique, Cameroon"
    - "Institut des Recherches Agricoles du Bénin" and "Institut National des Recherche Agricoles du Benin" and "National Agricultural Research Institute, Benin"
    - "Institute of Agronomic Research, Cameroon" and "Institute of Agronomy Research, Cameroon"
    - "Rivers State University" and "Rivers State University of Science and Technology"
    - "Universität Hannover" and "University of Hannover"
  - inconsistencies in `cg.subject.iita`:
    - "AMELIORATION DES PLANTES" and "AMÉLIORATION DES PLANTES"
    - "PRODUCTION VEGETALE" and "PRODUCTION VÉGÉTALE"
    - "CONTRÔLE DE MALADIES" and "CONTROLE DES MALADIES"
    - "HANDLING, TRANSPORT, STORAGE AND PROTECTION OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT" and "HANDLING, TRANSPORT, STORAGE AND PROTECTION OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS"
    - "RAVAGEURS DE PLANTES" and "RAVAGEURS DES PLANTES"
    - "SANTE DES PLANTES" and "SANTÉ DES PLANTES"
    - "SOCIOECONOMIE" and "SOCIOECONOMY"
  - inconsistencies in `dc.description.sponsorship`:
    - "Belgian Corporation" and "Belgium Corporation"
  - inconsistencies in `dc.subject`:
    - "AFRICAN CASSAVA MOSAIC" and "AFRICAN CASSAVA MOSAIC DISEASE"
    - "ASPERGILLU FLAVUS" and "ASPERGILLUS FLAVUS"
    - "BIOTECHNOLOGIES" and "BIOTECHNOLOGY"
    - "CASSAVA MOSAIC DISEASE" and "CASSAVA MOSAIC DISEASES" and "CASSAVA MOSAIC VIRUS"
    - "CASSAVA PROCESSING" and "CASSAVA PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY"
    - "CROPPING SYSTEM" and "CROPPING SYSTEMS"
    - "DRY SEASON" and "DRY-SEASON"
    - "FERTILIZER" and "FERTILIZERS"
    - "LEGUME" and "LEGUMES"
    - "LEGUMINOSAE" and "LEGUMINOUS"
    - "LEGUMINOUS COVER CROP" and "LEGUMINOUS COVER CROPS"
    - "MATÉRIEL DE PLANTATION" and "MATÉRIELS DE PLANTATION"
  - I noticed that some records do have encoding errors in the `dc.description.abstract` field, but only four of them so probably not from Abenet's handling of the XLS file
  - Based on manually eyeballing the text I used a custom text facet with this GREL to identify the records:

```
or(
  value.contains('€'),
  value.contains('6g'),
  value.contains('6m'),
  value.contains('6d'),
  value.contains('6e')
)
```
  - So IITA should double check the abstracts for these:
    - https://dspacetest.cgiar.org/10568/96184
    - https://dspacetest.cgiar.org/10568/96141
    - https://dspacetest.cgiar.org/10568/96118
    - https://dspacetest.cgiar.org/10568/96113

## 2018-06-13

- Elizabeth from CIAT contacted me to ask if I could add ORCID identifiers to all of Robin Buruchara's items
- I used my [add-orcid-identifiers-csv.py](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/alanorth/a49d85cd9c5dea89cddbe809813a7050/raw/f67b6e45a9a940732882ae4bb26897a9b245ef31/add-orcid-identifiers-csv.py) script:

```
$ ./add-orcid-identifiers-csv.py -i 2018-06-13-Robin-Buruchara.csv -db dspace -u dspace -p 'fuuu'
```

- The contents of `2018-06-13-Robin-Buruchara.csv` were:

```
dc.contributor.author,cg.creator.id
"Buruchara, Robin",Robin Buruchara: 0000-0003-0934-1218
"Buruchara, Robin A.",Robin Buruchara: 0000-0003-0934-1218
```

- On a hunch I checked to see if CGSpace's bitstream cleanup was working properly and of course it's broken:

```
$ dspace cleanup -v
...
Error: ERROR: update or delete on table "bitstream" violates foreign key constraint "bundle_primary_bitstream_id_fkey" on table "bundle"
  Detail: Key (bitstream_id)=(152402) is still referenced from table "bundle".
```

- As always, the solution is to delete that ID manually in PostgreSQL:

```
$ psql dspace -c 'update bundle set primary_bitstream_id=NULL where primary_bitstream_id in (152402);'
UPDATE 1
```
