## 2022-05-04

- I found a few more IPs making requests using the shady Chrome 44 user agent in the last few days so I will add them to the block list too:
  - 18.207.136.176
  - 185.189.36.248
  - 50.118.223.78
  - 52.70.76.123
  - 3.236.10.11
- Looking at the Solr statistics for 2022-04
  - 52.191.137.59 is Microsoft, but they are using a normal user agent and making tens of thousands of requests
  - 64.39.98.62 is owned by Qualys, and all their requests are probing for /etc/passwd etc
  - 185.192.69.15 is in the Netherlands and is using a normal user agent, but making excessive automated HTTP requests to paths forbidden in robots.txt
  - 157.55.39.159 is owned by Microsoft and identifies as bingbot so I don't know why its requests were logged in Solr
  - 52.233.67.176 is owned by Microsoft and uses a normal user agent, but making excessive automated HTTP requests
  - 157.55.39.144 is owned by Microsoft and uses a normal user agent, but making excessive automated HTTP requests
  - 207.46.13.177 is owned by Microsoft and identifies as bingbot so I don't know why its requests were logged in Solr
  - If I query Solr for `time:2022-04* AND dns:*msnbot* AND dns:*.msn.com.` I see a handful of IPs that made 41,000 requests
- I purged 93,974 hits from these IPs using my `check-spider-ip-hits.sh` script

- Now looking at the Solr statistics by user agent I see:
  - `SomeRandomText`
  - `RestSharp/106.11.7.0`
  - `MetaInspector/5.7.0 (+https://github.com/jaimeiniesta/metainspector)`
  - `wp_is_mobile`
  - `Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; um-LN/1.0; mailto: techinfo@ubermetrics-technologies.com; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:40.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/40.1"`
  - `insomnia/2022.2.1`
  - `ZoteroTranslationServer`
  - `omgili/0.5 +http://omgili.com`
  - `curb`
  - `Sprout Social (Link Attachment)`
- I purged 2,900 hits from these user agents from Solr using my `check-spider-hits.sh` script
- I made a [pull request to COUNTER-Robots](https://github.com/atmire/COUNTER-Robots/pull/54) for some of these agents
  - In the mean time I will add them to our local overrides in DSpace
