## 2017-02-07

- An item was mapped twice erroneously again, so I had to remove one of the mappings manually:

```
dspace=# select * from collection2item where item_id = '80278';
  id   | collection_id | item_id
-------+---------------+---------
 92551 |           313 |   80278
 92550 |           313 |   80278
 90774 |          1051 |   80278
(3 rows)
dspace=# delete from collection2item where id = 92551 and item_id = 80278;
DELETE 1
```
