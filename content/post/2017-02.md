- An item was mapped twice erroneously again, so I had to remove one of the mappings manually:

```
dspace=# select * from collection2item where item_id = '80278';
  id   | collection_id | item_id
-------+---------------+---------
 92551 |           313 |   80278
 92550 |           313 |   80278
 90774 |          1051 |   80278
(3 rows)
dspace=# delete from collection2item where id = 92551 and item_id = 80278;
DELETE 1
```

- Create issue on GitHub to track the addition of CCAFS Phase II project tags ([#301](https://github.com/ilri/DSpace/issues/301))
- Looks like we'll be using `cg.identifier.ccafsprojectpii` as the field name

- We also need to rename some of the CCAFS Phase I flagships:
  - CLIMATE-SMART AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES → CLIMATE-SMART TECHNOLOGIES AND PRACTICES
  - CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT → CLIMATE SERVICES AND SAFETY NETS
  - LOW EMISSIONS AGRICULTURE → LOW EMISSIONS DEVELOPMENT
  - POLICIES AND INSTITUTIONS → PRIORITIES AND POLICIES FOR CSA
- The climate risk management one doesn't exist, so I will have to ask Magdalena if they want me to add it to the input forms
