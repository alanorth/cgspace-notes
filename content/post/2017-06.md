## 2017-06-01

- After discussion with WLE and CGSpace content people, we decided to just add one metadata field for the WLE Research Themes
- The `cg.identifier.wletheme` field will be used for both Phase I and Phase II Research Themes
- Then we'll create a new sub-community for Phase II and create collections for the research themes there
- The current "Research Themes" community will be renamed to "WLE Phase I Research Themes"
- Tagged all items in the current Phase I collections with their appropriate themes
- Create pull request to add Phase II research themes to the submission form: [#328](https://github.com/ilri/DSpace/pull/328)
- Add `cg.subject.system` to CGSpace metadata registry, for subject from the upcoming CGIAR Library migration

- After adding `cg.identifier.wletheme` to 1106 WLE items I can see the field on XMLUI but not in REST!
- Strangely it happens on DSpace Test AND on CGSpace!
- I tried to re-index Discovery but it didn't fix it
- Run all system updates on DSpace Test and reboot the server
- After rebooting the server (and therefore restarting Tomcat) the new metadata field is available
- I've sent a message to the dspace-tech mailing list to ask if this is a bug and whether I should file a Jira ticket
