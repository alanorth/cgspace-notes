## 2017-06-01

- After discussion with WLE and CGSpace content people, we decided to just add one metadata field for the WLE Research Themes
- The `cg.identifier.wletheme` field will be used for both Phase I and Phase II Research Themes
- Then we'll create a new sub-community for Phase II and create collections for the research themes there
- The current "Research Themes" community will be renamed to "WLE Phase I Research Themes"
- Tagged all items in the current Phase I collections with their appropriate themes
- Create pull request to add Phase II research themes to the submission form: [#328](https://github.com/ilri/DSpace/pull/328)
- Add `cg.subject.system` to CGSpace metadata registry, for subject from the upcoming CGIAR Library migration
