## 2017-11-01

- The CORE developers responded to say they are looking into their bot not respecting our robots.txt

## 2017-11-02

- Today there have been no hits by CORE and no alerts from Linode (coincidence?)

```
# grep -c "CORE" /var/log/nginx/access.log
0
```

- Generate list of authors on CGSpace for Peter to go through and correct:

```
dspace=# \copy (select distinct text_value, count(*) as count from metadatavalue where metadata_field_id = (select metadata_field_id from metadatafieldregistry where element = 'contributor' and qualifier = 'author') AND resource_type_id = 2 group by text_value order by count desc) to /tmp/authors.csv with csv;
COPY 54701
```
