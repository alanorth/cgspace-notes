- Testing adding [ORCIDs to a CSV](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSDOC5x/ORCID+Integration#ORCIDIntegration-EditingexistingitemsusingBatchCSVEditing) file for a single item to see if the author orders get messed up
- Need to test the following scenarios to see how author order is affected:
  - ORCIDs only
  - ORCIDs plus normal authors
- I exported a random item's metadata as CSV, deleted *all columns* except id and collection, and made a new coloum called `ORCID:dc.contributor.author` with the following random ORCIDs from the ORCID registry:

```
0000-0002-6115-0956||0000-0002-3812-8793||0000-0001-7462-405X
```

- Hmm, with the `dc.contributor.author` column removed, DSpace doesn't detect any changes
- With a blank `dc.contributor.author` column, DSpace wants to remove all non-ORCID authors and add the new ORCID authors
- I added the [disclaimer text](https://github.com/ilri/DSpace/issues/234) to the About page, then added a footer link to the disclaimer's ID, but there is a Bootstrap issue that causes the page content to disappear when using in-page anchors: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/1768

![Bootstrap issue with in-page anchors](2016/10/bootstrap-issue.png)

- Looks like we'll just have to add the text to the About page (without a link) or add a separate page

- Start testing cleanups of authors that Peter sent last week
- Out of 40,000+ rows, Peter had indicated corrections for ~3,200 of themâ€”too many to look through carefully, so I did some basic quality checking:
  - Trim leading/trailing whitespace
  - Find invalid characters
  - Cluster values to merge obvious authors
- That left us with 3,180 valid corrections and 3 deletions:

```
$ ./fix-metadata-values.py -i authors-fix-3180.csv -f dc.contributor.author -t correct -m 3 -d dspacetest -u dspacetest -p fuuu
$ ./delete-metadata-values.py -i authors-delete-3.csv -f dc.contributor.author -m 3 -d dspacetest -u dspacetest -p fuuu
```

- Remove old about page ([#284](https://github.com/ilri/DSpace/pull/284))
