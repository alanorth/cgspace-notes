## 2017-01-02

- I checked to see if the Solr sharding task that is supposed to run on January 1st had run and saw there was an error
- I tested on DSpace Test as well and it doesn't work there either
- I asked on the dspace-tech mailing list because it seems to be broken, and actually now I'm not sure if we've ever had the sharding task run successfully over all these years
