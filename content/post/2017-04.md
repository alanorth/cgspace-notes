## 2017-04-02

- Merge one change to CCAFS flagships that I had forgotten to remove last month ("MANAGING CLIMATE RISK"): https://github.com/ilri/DSpace/pull/317
- Quick proof-of-concept hack to add `dc.rights` to the input form, including some inline instructions/hints:

![dc.rights in the submission form](/cgspace-notes/2017/04/dc-rights.png)

- Remove redundant/duplicate text in the DSpace submission license
- Testing the CMYK patch on a collection with 650 items:

```
$ [dspace]/bin/dspace filter-media -f -i 10568/16498 -p "ImageMagick PDF Thumbnail" -v >& /tmp/filter-media-cmyk.txt
```

<!--more-->

## 2017-04-03

- Continue testing the CMYK patch on more communities:

```
$ [dspace]/bin/dspace filter-media -f -i 10568/1 -p "ImageMagick PDF Thumbnail" -v >> /tmp/filter-media-cmyk.txt 2>&1
```

- So far there are almost 500:

```
$ grep -c profile /tmp/filter-media-cmyk.txt
484
```

- Looking at the CG Core document again, I'll send some feedback to Peter and Abenet:
  - We use cg.contributor.crp to indicate the CRP(s) affiliated with the item
  - DSpace has dc.date.available, but this field isn't particularly meaningful other than as an automatic timestamp at the time of item accession (and is identical to dc.date.accessioned)
  - dc.relation exists in CGSpace, but isn't usedâ€”rather dc.relation.ispartofseries, which is used ~5,000 times to Series name and number within that series
- Also, I'm noticing some weird outliers in `cg.coverage.region`, need to remember to go correct these later:

```
dspace=# select text_value from metadatavalue where resource_type_id=2 and metadata_field_id=227;
```

## 2017-04-04

- The `filter-media` script has been running on more large communities and now there are many more CMYK PDFs that have been fixed:

```
$ grep -c profile /tmp/filter-media-cmyk.txt
1584
```
