## 2017-09-06

- Linode sent an alert that CGSpace (linode18) was using 261% CPU for the past two hours

<!--more-->

## 2017-09-07

- Ask Sisay to clean up the WLE approvers a bit, as Marianne's user account is both in the approvers step as well as the group

## 2017-09-10

- Delete 58 blank metadata values from the CGSpace database:

```
dspace=# delete from metadatavalue where resource_type_id=2 and text_value='';
DELETE 58
```

- I also ran it on DSpace Test because we'll be migrating the CGIAR Library soon and it would be good to catch these before we migrate
- Run system updates and restart DSpace Test
- We only have 7.7GB of free space on DSpace Test so I need to copy some data off of it before doing the CGIAR Library migration (requires lots of exporting and creating temp files)
- I still have the original data from the CGIAR Library so I've zipped it up and sent it off to linode18 for now
- sha256sum of `original-cgiar-library-6.6GB.tar.gz` is: bcfabb52f51cbdf164b61b7e9b3a0e498479e4c1ed1d547d32d11f44c0d5eb8a
- Start doing a test run of the CGIAR Library migration locally
- Notes and todo checklist here for now: https://gist.github.com/alanorth/3579b74e116ab13418d187ed379abd9c
- Create pull request for Phase I and II changes to CCAFS Project Tags: [#336](https://github.com/ilri/DSpace/pull/336)
- We've been discussing with Macaroni Bros and CCAFS for the past month or so and the list of tags was recently finalized
- There will need to be some metadata updates — though if I recall correctly it is only about seven records — for that as well, I had made some notes about it in [2017-07](/cgspace-notes/2017-07), but I've asked for more clarification from Lili just in case
