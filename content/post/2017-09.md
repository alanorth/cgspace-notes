## 2017-09-06

- Linode sent an alert that CGSpace (linode18) was using 261% CPU for the past two hours

- Ask Sisay to clean up the WLE approvers a bit, as Marianne's user account is both in the approvers step as well as the group

## 2017-09-10

- Delete 58 blank metadata values from the CGSpace database:

```
dspace=# delete from metadatavalue where resource_type_id=2 and text_value='';
DELETE 58
```

- I also ran it on DSpace Test because we'll be migrating the CGIAR Library soon and it would be good to catch these before we migrate
- Run system updates and restart DSpace Test
- We only have 7.7GB of free space on DSpace Test so I need to copy some data off of it before doing the CGIAR Library migration (requires lots of exporting and creating temp files)
- I still have the original data from the CGIAR Library so I've zipped it up and sent it off to linode18 for now
- sha256sum of `original-cgiar-library-6.6GB.tar.gz` is: bcfabb52f51cbdf164b61b7e9b3a0e498479e4c1ed1d547d32d11f44c0d5eb8a
