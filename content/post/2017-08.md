## 2017-08-01

- Linode sent an alert that CGSpace (linode18) was using 350% CPU for the past two hours
- I looked in the Activity pane of the Admin Control Panel and it seems that Google, Baidu, Yahoo, and Bing are all crawling with massive numbers of bots concurrently (~100 total, mostly Baidu and Google)
- The good thing is that, according to `dspace.log.2017-08-01`, they are all using the same Tomcat session
- This means our Tomcat Crawler Session Valve is working
- But many of the bots are browsing dynamic URLs like:
  - /handle/10568/3353/discover
  - /handle/10568/16510/browse
- The `robots.txt` only blocks the top-level `/discover` and `/browse` URLs... we will need to find a way to forbid them from accessing these!
- Relevant issue from DSpace Jira (semi resolved in DSpace 6.0): https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-2962
- It turns out that we're already adding the `X-Robots-Tag "none"` HTTP header, but this only forbids the search engine from _indexing_ the page, not crawling it!
- Also, the bot has to successfully browse the page first so it can receive the HTTP header...
