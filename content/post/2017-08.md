## 2017-08-01

- Linode sent an alert that CGSpace (linode18) was using 350% CPU for the past two hours
- I looked in the Activity pane of the Admin Control Panel and it seems that Google, Baidu, Yahoo, and Bing are all crawling with massive numbers of bots concurrently (~100 total, mostly Baidu and Google)
- The good thing is that, according to `dspace.log.2017-08-01`, they are all using the same Tomcat session
- This means our Tomcat Crawler Session Valve is working
- But many of the bots are browsing dynamic URLs like:
  - /handle/10568/3353/discover
  - /handle/10568/16510/browse
- The `robots.txt` only blocks the top-level `/discover` and `/browse` URLs... we will need to find a way to forbid them from accessing these!
- Relevant issue from DSpace Jira (semi resolved in DSpace 6.0): https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-2962
- It turns out that we're already adding the `X-Robots-Tag "none"` HTTP header, but this only forbids the search engine from _indexing_ the page, not crawling it!
- Also, the bot has to successfully browse the page first so it can receive the HTTP header...
- We might actually have to _block_ these requests with HTTP 403 depending on the user agent
- Abenet pointed out that the CGIAR Library Historical Archive collection I sent July 20th only had ~100 entries, instead of 2415
- This was due to newline characters in the `dc.description.abstract` column, which caused OpenRefine to choke when exporting the CSV
- I exported a new CSV from the collection on DSpace Test and then manually removed the characters in vim using `g/^$/d`
- Then I cleaned up the author authorities and HTML characters in OpenRefine and sent the file back to Abenet

- Magdalena from CCAFS asked if there was a way to get the top ten items published in 2016 (note: not the top items in 2016!)
- I think Atmire's Content and Usage Analysis module should be able to do this but I will have to look at the configuration and maybe email Atmire if I can't figure it out
- I had a look at the moduel configuration and couldn't figure out a way to do this, so I [opened a ticket on the Atmire tracker](https://tracker.atmire.com/tickets-cgiar-ilri/view-tickets)
- Atmire responded about the [missing workflow statistics issue](https://tracker.atmire.com/tickets-cgiar-ilri/view-ticket?id=500) a few weeks ago but I didn't see it for some reason
- They said they added a publication and saw the workflow stat for the user, so I should try again and let them know

- Usman from CIFOR emailed to ask about the status of our OAI tests for harvesting their DSpace repository
- I told him that the OAI appears to not be harvesting properly after the first sync, and that the control panel shows an "Internal error" for that collection:

![CIFOR OAI harvesting](/cgspace-notes/2017/08/cifor-oai-harvesting.png)

- I don't see anything related in our logs, so I asked him to check for our server's IP in their logs
- Also, in the mean time I stopped the harvesting process, reset the status, and restarted the process via the Admin control panel (note: I didn't reset the collection, just the harvester status!)
