## 2015-11-22

- CGSpace went down
- Looks like DSpace exhausted its PostgreSQL connection pool
- Last week I had increased the limit from 30 to 60, which seemed to help, but now there are many more idle connections:

```
$ psql -c 'SELECT * from pg_stat_activity;' | grep idle | grep -c cgspace
78
```

- For now I have increased the limit from 60 to 90, run updates, and rebooted the server

- CGSpace went down again
- Getting emails from uptimeRobot and uptimeButler that it's down, and Google Webmaster Tools is sending emails that there is an increase in crawl errors
- Looks like there are still a bunch of idle PostgreSQL connections:

```
$ psql -c 'SELECT * from pg_stat_activity;' | grep idle | grep -c cgspace
96
```

- For some reason the number of idle connections is very high since we upgraded to DSpace 5
