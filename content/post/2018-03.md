## 2018-03-02

- Export a CSV of the IITA community metadata for Martin Mueller

<!--more-->

## 2018-03-06

- Add three new CCAFS project tags to `input-forms.xml` ([#357](https://github.com/ilri/DSpace/pull/357))
- Andrea from Macaroni Bros had sent me an email that CCAFS needs them
- Give Udana more feedback on his WLE records from last month
- There were some records using a non-breaking space in their AGROVOC subject field
- I checked and tested some author corrections from Peter from last week, and then applied them on CGSpace

```
$ ./fix-metadata-values.py -i Correct-309-authors-2018-03-06.csv -db dspace -u dspace -p 'fuuu' -f dc.contributor.author -t correct -m 3      
$ ./delete-metadata-values.py -i Delete-3-Authors-2018-03-06.csv -db dspace -u dspace-p 'fuuu' -f dc.contributor.author -m 3
```

- This time there were no errors in whitespace but I did have to correct one incorrectly encoded accent character
- Add new CRP subject "GRAIN LEGUMES AND DRYLAND CEREALS" to `input-forms.xml` ([#358](https://github.com/ilri/DSpace/pull/358))
- Merge the ORCID integration stuff in to `5_x-prod` for deployment on CGSpace soon ([#359](https://github.com/ilri/DSpace/pull/359))
- Deploy ORCID changes on CGSpace (linode18), run all system updates, and reboot the server
- Run all system updates on DSpace Test and reboot server
- I ran the [orcid-authority-to-item.py](https://gist.github.com/alanorth/24d8081a5dc25e2a4e27e548e7e2389c) script on CGSpace and mapped 2,864 ORCID identifiers from Solr to item metadata

```
$ ./orcid-authority-to-item.py -db dspace -u dspace -p 'fuuu' -s http://localhost:8081/solr -d
```

- I ran the DSpace cleanup script on CGSpace and it threw an error (as always):

```
Error: ERROR: update or delete on table "bitstream" violates foreign key constraint "bundle_primary_bitstream_id_fkey" on table "bundle"
  Detail: Key (bitstream_id)=(150659) is still referenced from table "bundle".
```

- The solution is, as always:
```
$ psql dspace -c 'update bundle set primary_bitstream_id=NULL where primary_bitstream_id in (150659);'
UPDATE 1
```

- Apply the proposed PostgreSQL indexes from DS-3636 (pull request [#1791](https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/1791/) on CGSpace (linode18)
