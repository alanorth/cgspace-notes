## 2018-03-06

- Add three new CCAFS project tags to `input-forms.xml` ([#357](https://github.com/ilri/DSpace/pull/357))
- Andrea from Macaroni Bros had sent me an email that CCAFS needs them
- Give Udana more feedback on his WLE records from last month
- There were some records using a non-breaking space in their AGROVOC subject field
- I checked and tested some author corrections from Peter from last week, and then applied them on CGSpace

```
$ ./fix-metadata-values.py -i Correct-309-authors-2018-03-06.csv -db dspace -u dspace -p 'fuuu' -f dc.contributor.author -t correct -m 3      
$ ./delete-metadata-values.py -i Delete-3-Authors-2018-03-06.csv -db dspace -u dspace-p 'fuuu' -f dc.contributor.author -m 3
```

- This time there were no errors in whitespace but I did have to correct one incorrectly encoded accent character
