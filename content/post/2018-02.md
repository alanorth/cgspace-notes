## 2018-02-01

- Peter gave feedback on the `dc.rights` proof of concept that I had sent him last week
- We don't need to distinguish between internal and external works, so that makes it just a simple list
- Yesterday I figured out how to monitor DSpace sessions using JMX
- I copied the logic in the `jmx_tomcat_dbpools` provided by Ubuntu's `munin-plugins-java` package and used the stuff I discovered about JMX [in 2018-01]({{< relref "2018-01.md" >}})

- Run all system updates and reboot DSpace Test
- Wow, I packaged up the `jmx_dspace_sessions` stuff in the [Ansible infrastructure scripts](https://github.com/ilri/rmg-ansible-public) and deployed it on CGSpace and it totally works:

```
# munin-run jmx_dspace_sessions
v_.value 223
v_jspui.value 1
v_oai.value 0
```

- Bram from Atmire responded about the high load caused by the Solr updater script and said it will be fixed with the updates to DSpace 5.8 compatibility: https://tracker.atmire.com/tickets-cgiar-ilri/view-ticket?id=566
- We will close that ticket for now and wait for the 5.8 stuff: https://tracker.atmire.com/tickets-cgiar-ilri/view-ticket?id=560
