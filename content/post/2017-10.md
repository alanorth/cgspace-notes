- Peter emailed to point out that many items in the [ILRI archive collection](https://cgspace.cgiar.org/handle/10568/2703) have multiple handles:

```
http://hdl.handle.net/10568/78495||http://hdl.handle.net/10568/79336
```

- There appears to be a pattern but I'll have to look a bit closer and try to clean them up automatically, either in SQL or in OpenRefine
- Add Katherine Lutz to the groups for content sumission and edit steps of the CGIAR System collections
