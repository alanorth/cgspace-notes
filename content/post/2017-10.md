## 2017-10-01

- Peter emailed to point out that many items in the [ILRI archive collection](https://cgspace.cgiar.org/handle/10568/2703) have multiple handles:

```
http://hdl.handle.net/10568/78495||http://hdl.handle.net/10568/79336
```

- There appears to be a pattern but I'll have to look a bit closer and try to clean them up automatically, either in SQL or in OpenRefine
- Add Katherine Lutz to the groups for content sumission and edit steps of the CGIAR System collections

- Peter Ballantyne said he was having problems logging into CGSpace with "both" of his accounts (CGIAR LDAP and personal, apparently)
- I looked in the logs and saw some LDAP lookup failures due to timeout but also strangely a "no DN found" error:

```

```

- Seeing as yesterday was the first of the month I think it could actually be that his LDAP account expired
- It looks like he was able to log in with his private account actually
