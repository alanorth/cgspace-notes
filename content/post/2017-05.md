## 2017-05-01

- ICARDA apparently started working on CG Core on their MEL repository
- They have done a few `cg.*` fields, but not very consistent and even copy some of CGSpace items:
    - https://mel.cgiar.org/xmlui/handle/20.500.11766/6911?show=full
    - https://cgspace.cgiar.org/handle/10568/73683

## 2017-05-02

- Atmire got back about the Workflow Statistics issue, and apparently it's a bug in the CUA module so they will send us a pull request

## 2017-05-04

- Sync DSpace Test with database and assetstore from CGSpace
- Re-deploy DSpace Test with Atmire's CUA patch for workflow statistics, run system updates, and restart the server
- Now I can see the workflow statistics and am able to select users, but everything returns 0 items
- Megan says there are still some mapped items are not appearing since last week, so I forced a full `index-discovery -b`
- Need to remember to check if the collection has more items (currently 39 on CGSpace, but 118 on the freshly reindexed DSPace Test) tomorrow: https://cgspace.cgiar.org/handle/10568/80731

## 2017-05-05

- Discovered that CGSpace has ~700 items that are missing the `cg.identifier.status` field
- Need to perhaps try using the "required metadata" curation task to find fields missing these items:

```
$ [dspace]/bin/dspace curate -t requiredmetadata -i 10568/1 -r - > /tmp/curation.out
```

- It seems the curation task dies when it finds an item which has missing metadata

## 2017-05-06

- Add "Blog Post" to `dc.type`
- Create ticket on Atmire tracker to ask about commissioning them to develop the feature to expose ORCID via REST/OAI: https://tracker.atmire.com/tickets-cgiar-ilri/view-ticket?id=510
- According to the [DSpace curation docs](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSDOC5x/Curation+System) the fact that the `requiredmetadata` curation task stops when it finds a missing metadata field is by design

## 2017-05-07

- Testing one replacement for CCAFS Flagships (`cg.subject.ccafs`), first changed in the submission forms, and then in the database:

```
$ ./fix-metadata-values.py -i ccafs-flagships-may7.csv -f cg.subject.ccafs -t correct -m 210 -d dspace -u dspace -p fuuu
```

- Also, CCAFS wants to re-order their flagships to prioritize the Phase II ones
- Waiting for feedback from CCAFS, then I can merge [#320](https://github.com/ilri/DSpace/pull/320)

## 2017-05-08

- Give feedback to CIFOR about their data quality:
  - Suggestion: uppercase dc.subject, cg.coverage.region, and cg.coverage.subregion in your crosswalk so they match CGSpace and therefore can be faceted / reported on easier
  - Suggestion: use CGSpace's CRP names (cg.contributor.crp), see: dspace/config/input-forms.xml
  - Suggestion: clean up duplicates and errors in funders, perhaps use a controlled vocabulary like ours, see: dspace/config/controlled-vocabularies/dc-description-sponsorship.xml
  - Suggestion: use dc.type "Blog Post" instead of "Blog" for your blog post items (we are also adding a "Blog Post" type to CGSpace soon)
  - Question: many of your items use dc.document.uri AND cg.identifier.url with the same text value?
- Help Marianne from WLE with an Open Search query to show the latest WLE CRP outputs: https://cgspace.cgiar.org/open-search/discover?query=crpsubject:WATER%2C+LAND+AND+ECOSYSTEMS&sort_by=2&order=DESC
- This uses the webui's item list sort options, see `webui.itemlist.sort-option` in `dspace.cfg`
- The equivalent Discovery search would be: https://cgspace.cgiar.org/discover?filtertype_1=crpsubject&filter_relational_operator_1=equals&filter_1=WATER%2C+LAND+AND+ECOSYSTEMS&submit_apply_filter=&query=&rpp=10&sort_by=dc.date.issued_dt&order=desc
