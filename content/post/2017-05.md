## 2017-05-01

- ICARDA apparently started working on CG Core on their MEL repository
- They have done a few `cg.*` fields, but not very consistent and even copy some of CGSpace items:
    - https://mel.cgiar.org/xmlui/handle/20.500.11766/6911?show=full
    - https://cgspace.cgiar.org/handle/10568/73683

- Atmire got back about the Workflow Statistics issue, and apparently it's a bug in the CUA module so they will send us a pull request

## 2017-05-04

- Sync DSpace Test with database and assetstore from CGSpace
- Re-deploy DSpace Test with Atmire's CUA patch for workflow statistics, run system updates, and restart the server
- Now I can see the workflow statistics and am able to select users, but everything returns 0 items
