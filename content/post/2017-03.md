- Run the 279 CIAT author corrections on CGSpace

## 2017-03-02

- Skype with Michael and Peter, discussing moving the CGIAR Library to CGSpace
- CGIAR people possibly open to moving content, redirecting library.cgiar.org to CGSpace and letting CGSpace resolve their handles
- They might come in at the top level in one "CGIAR System" community, or with several communities
- I need to spend a bit of time looking at the multiple handle support in DSpace and see if new content can be minted in both handles, or just one?
- Need to send Peter and Michael some notes about this in a few days
- Also, need to consider talking to Atmire about hiring them to bring ORCiD metadata to REST / OAI
- Filed an issue on DSpace issue tracker for the `filter-media` bug that causes it to process JPGs even when limiting to the PDF thumbnail plugin: [DS-3516](https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-3516)
- Discovered that the ImageMagic `filter-media` plugin creates JPG thumbnails with the CMYK colorspace when the source PDF is using CMYK
- Interestingly, it seems DSpace 4.x's thumbnails were sRGB, but forcing regeneration using DSpace 5.x's ImageMagick plugin creates CMYK JPGs if the source PDF was CMYK (see [10568/51999](https://cgspace.cgiar.org/handle/10568/51999)):

```
$ identify ~/Desktop/alc_contrastes_desafios.jpg
/Users/aorth/Desktop/alc_contrastes_desafios.jpg JPEG 464x600 464x600+0+0 8-bit CMYK 168KB 0.000u 0:00.000
```

<!--more-->

- This results in discolored thumbnails when compared to the original PDF, for example sRGB and CMYK:

![Thumbnail in sRGB colorspace](/cgspace-notes/2017/03/thumbnail-srgb.jpg)

![Thumbnial in CMYK colorspace](/cgspace-notes/2017/03/thumbnail-cmyk.jpg)

- I filed an issue for the color space thing: [DS-3517](https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-3517)

## 2017-03-03

- I created a patch for DS-3517 and made a pull request against upstream `dspace-5_x`: https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/1669
- Looks like `-colorspace sRGB` alone isn't enough, we need to use profiles:

```
$ convert alc_contrastes_desafios.pdf\[0\] -profile /opt/brew/Cellar/ghostscript/9.20/share/ghostscript/9.20/iccprofiles/default_cmyk.icc -thumbnail 300x300 -flatten -profile /opt/brew/Cellar/ghostscript/9.20/share/ghostscript/9.20/iccprofiles/default_rgb.icc alc_contrastes_desafios.pdf.jpg
```

- This reads the input file, applies the CMYK profile, applies the RGB profile, then writes the file
- Note that you should set the first profile immediately after the input file
- Also, it is better to use profiles than setting `-colorspace`
- This is a great resource describing the color stuff: http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/formats/#profiles
- Somehow we need to detect the color system being used by the input file and handle each case differently (with profiles)
- This is trivial with `identify` (even by the [Java ImageMagick API](http://im4java.sourceforge.net/api/org/im4java/core/IMOps.html#identify)):

```
$ identify -format '%r\n' alc_contrastes_desafios.pdf\[0\]
DirectClass CMYK
$ identify -format '%r\n' Africa\ group\ of\ negotiators.pdf\[0\]
DirectClass sRGB Alpha
```

## 2017-03-04

- Spent more time looking at the ImageMagick CMYK issue
- The `default_cmyk.icc` and `default_rgb.icc` files are both part of the Ghostscript GPL distribution, but according to DSpace's `LICENSES_THIRD_PARTY` file, DSpace doesn't allow distribution of dependencies that are licensed solely under the GPL
- So this issue is kinda pointless now, as the ICC profiles are absolutely necessary to make a meaningful CMYKâ†’sRGB conversion

## 2017-03-05

- Look into helping developers from landportal.info with a query for items related to LAND on the REST API
- They want something like the items that are returned by the general "LAND" query in the search interface, but we cannot do that
- We can only return specific results for metadata fields, like:

```
$ curl -s -H "accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST "https://dspacetest.cgiar.org/rest/items/find-by-metadata-field" -d '{"key": "cg.subject.ilri","value": "LAND REFORM", "language": null}' | json_pp
```

- But there are hundreds of combinations of fields and values (like `dc.subject` and all the center subjects), and we can't use wildcards in REST!
- Reading about enabling multiple handle prefixes in DSpace
- There is a mailing list thread from 2011 about it: http://dspace.2283337.n4.nabble.com/Multiple-handle-prefixes-merged-DSpace-instances-td3427192.html
- And a comment from Atmire's Bram about it on the DSpace wiki: https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSDOC5x/Installing+DSpace?focusedCommentId=78163296#comment-78163296
- Bram mentions an undocumented configuration option `handle.plugin.checknameauthority`, but I noticed another one in `dspace.cfg`: 

```
# List any additional prefixes that need to be managed by this handle server
# (as for examle handle prefix coming from old dspace repository merged in
# that repository)
# handle.additional.prefixes = prefix1[, prefix2]
```

- Because of this I noticed that our Handle server's `config.dct` was potentially misconfigured!
- We had some default values still present:

```
"300:0.NA/YOUR_NAMING_AUTHORITY"
```

- I've changed them to the following and restarted the handle server:

```
"300:0.NA/10568"
```

- In looking at all the configs I just noticed that we are not providing a DOI in the Google-specific metadata crosswalk
- From `dspace/config/crosswalks/google-metadata.properties`:

```
google.citation_doi = cg.identifier.doi
```

- This works, and makes DSpace output the following metadata on the item view page:

```
<meta content="https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13059-017-1153-y" name="citation_doi">
```

- Submitted and merged pull request for this: https://github.com/ilri/DSpace/pull/305
- Submit pull request to set the author separator for XMLUI item lists to a semicolon instead of ",": https://github.com/ilri/DSpace/pull/306
- I want to show it briefly to Abenet and Peter to get feedback
