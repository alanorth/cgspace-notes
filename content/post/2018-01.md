## 2018-01-02

- Uptime Robot noticed that CGSpace went down and up a few times last night, for a few minutes each time
- I didn't get any load alerts from Linode and the REST and XMLUI logs don't show anything out of the ordinary
- The nginx logs show HTTP 200s until `02/Jan/2018:11:27:17 +0000` when Uptime Robot got an HTTP 500
- In dspace.log around that time I see many errors like "Client closed the connection before file download was complete"
- And just before that I see this:

```
Caused by: org.apache.tomcat.jdbc.pool.PoolExhaustedException: [http-bio-127.0.0.1-8443-exec-980] Timeout: Pool empty. Unable to fetch a connection in 5 seconds, none available[size:50; busy:50; idle:0; lastwait:5000].
```

- Ah hah! So the pool was actually empty!
- I need to increase that, let's try to bump it up from 50 to 75
- After that one client got an HTTP 499 but then the rest were HTTP 200, so I don't know what the hell Uptime Robot saw
- I notice this error quite a few times in dspace.log:

```
2018-01-02 01:21:19,137 ERROR org.dspace.app.xmlui.aspect.discovery.SidebarFacetsTransformer @ Error while searching for sidebar facets

```

- And there are many of these errors every day for the past month:

- Danny wrote to ask for help renewing the wildcard ilri.org certificate and I advised that we should probably use Let's Encrypt if it's just a handful of domains

## 2018-01-03

- I woke up to more up and down of CGSpace, this time UptimeRobot noticed a few rounds of up and down of a few minutes each and Linode also notified of high CPU load from 12 to 2 PM
- Looks like I need to increase the database pool size again:

```
$ grep -c "Timeout: Pool empty." dspace.log.2018-01-*
dspace.log.2018-01-01:0
dspace.log.2018-01-02:1972
dspace.log.2018-01-03:1909
```

- For some reason there were a lot of "active" connections last night:

![CGSpace PostgreSQL connections](/cgspace-notes/2018/01/postgres_connections-day.png)

- The active IPs in XMLUI are:

```
# cat /var/log/nginx/access.log /var/log/nginx/access.log.1 /var/log/nginx/library-access.log /var/log/nginx/library-access.log.1 | grep -E "3/Jan/2018" | awk '{print $1}' | sort -n | uniq -c | sort -h | tail
    607 40.77.167.141
    611 2a00:23c3:8c94:7800:392c:a491:e796:9c50
    663 188.226.169.37
    759 157.55.39.245
    887 68.180.229.254
   1037 157.55.39.175
   1068 216.244.66.245
   1495 66.249.64.91
   1934 104.196.152.243
   2219 134.155.96.78
```

- 134.155.96.78 appears to be at the University of Mannheim in Germany
- They identify as: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; heritrix/3.2.0 +http://ifm.uni-mannheim.de)
- This appears to be the [Internet Archive's open source bot](https://github.com/internetarchive/heritrix3)
- They seem to be re-using their Tomcat session so I don't need to do anything to them just yet:

```
$ grep 134.155.96.78 dspace.log.2018-01-03 | grep -o -E 'session_id=[A-Z0-9]{32}' | sort -n | uniq | wc -l
2
```

- The API logs show the normal users:

```
# cat /var/log/nginx/rest.log /var/log/nginx/rest.log.1 /var/log/nginx/oai.log /var/log/nginx/oai.log.1 | grep -E "3/Jan/2018" | awk '{print $1}' | sort -n | uniq -c | sort -h | tail
     32 207.46.13.182
     38 40.77.167.132
     38 68.180.229.254
     43 66.249.64.91
     46 40.77.167.141
     49 157.55.39.245
     79 157.55.39.175
   1533 50.116.102.77
   4069 70.32.83.92
   9355 45.5.184.196
```

- In other related news I see a sizeable amount of requests coming from python-requests
- For example, just in the last day there were 1700!

```
# cat /var/log/nginx/access.log /var/log/nginx/access.log.1 /var/log/nginx/library-access.log /var/log/nginx/library-access.log.1 | grep -c python-requests
1773
```

- But they come from hundreds of IPs, many of which are 54.x.x.x:

```
# cat /var/log/nginx/access.log /var/log/nginx/access.log.1 /var/log/nginx/library-access.log /var/log/nginx/library-access.log.1 | grep python-requests | awk '{print $1}' | sort -n | uniq -c | sort -h | tail -n 30

     21 54.211.119.107
    139 164.39.7.62
```

- I have no idea what these are but they seem to be coming from Amazon...
- I guess for now I just have to increase the database connection pool's max active
- It's currently 75 and normally I'd just bump it by 25 but let me be a bit daring and push it by 50 to 125, because I used to see at least 121 connections in pg_stat_activity before when we were using the shitty default pooling

## 2018-01-04

- CGSpace went down and up a bunch of times last night and ILRI staff were complaining a lot last night
- The XMLUI logs show this activity:

```
# cat /var/log/nginx/access.log /var/log/nginx/access.log.1 /var/log/nginx/library-access.log /var/log/nginx/library-access.log.1 | grep -E "4/Jan/2018" | awk '{print $1}' | sort -n | uniq -c | sort -h | tail
    968 197.211.63.81
    981 213.55.99.121
   1039 66.249.64.93
   1258 157.55.39.175
   1273 207.46.13.182
   1311 157.55.39.191
   1319 157.55.39.197
   1775 66.249.64.78
   2216 104.196.152.243
   3366 66.249.64.91
```

- Again we ran out of PostgreSQL database connections, even after bumping the pool max active limit from 50 to 75 to 125 yesterday!

```
2018-01-04 07:36:08,089 ERROR org.dspace.storage.rdbms.DatabaseManager @ SQL connection Error -
org.apache.tomcat.jdbc.pool.PoolExhaustedException: [http-bio-127.0.0.1-8443-exec-256] Timeout: Pool empty. Unable to fetch a connection in 5 seconds, none available[size:125; busy:125; idle:0; lastwait:5000].
```

- So for this week that is the number one problem!

```
$ grep -c "Timeout: Pool empty." dspace.log.2018-01-*
dspace.log.2018-01-01:0
dspace.log.2018-01-02:1972
dspace.log.2018-01-03:1909
dspace.log.2018-01-04:1559
```

- I will just bump the connection limit to 300 because I'm fucking fed up with this shit
- Once I get back to Amman I will have to try to create different database pools for different web applications, like recently discussed on the dspace-tech mailing list 
- Create accounts on CGSpace for two CTA staff km4ard@cta.int and bheenick@cta.int

## 2018-01-05

- Peter said that CGSpac was down last night and Tsega restarted Tomcat
- I don't see any alerts from Linode or UptimeRobot, and there are no PostgreSQL connection errors in the dspace logs for today:

```
$ grep -c "Timeout: Pool empty." dspace.log.2018-01-*
dspace.log.2018-01-01:0
dspace.log.2018-01-02:1972
dspace.log.2018-01-03:1909
dspace.log.2018-01-04:1559
dspace.log.2018-01-05:0
```

- Daniel asked for help with their DAGRIS server (linode2328112) that has no disk space
- I had a look and there is one Apache 2 log file that is 73GB, with lots of this:

```
[Fri Jan 05 09:31:22.965398 2018] [:error] [pid 9340] [client 213.55.99.121:64476] WARNING: Unable to find a match for "9-16-1-RV.doc" in "/home/files/journals/6//articles/9/". Skipping this file., referer: http://dagris.info/reviewtool/index.php/index/install/upgrade
```

- I will delete the log file for now and tell Danny
- Also, I'm still seeing a hundred or so of the "ERROR org.dspace.app.xmlui.aspect.discovery.SidebarFacetsTransformer" errors in dspace logs, I need to search the dspace-tech mailing list to see what the cause is
- I will run a full Discovery reindex in the mean time to see if it's something wrong with the Discovery Solr core
