## 2016-04-04

- Looking at log file use on CGSpace and notice that we need to work on our cron setup a bit
- We are backing up all logs in the log folder, including useless stuff like solr, cocoon, handle-plugin, etc
- After running DSpace for over five years I've never needed to look in any other log file than dspace.log, leave alone one from last year!
- This will save us a few gigs of backup space we're paying for on S3
- Also, I noticed the `checker` log has some errors we should pay attention to:

```

- So this would be the `tomcat7` Unix user, who seems to have a default limit of 1024 files in its shell
- For what it's worth, we have been setting the actual Tomcat 7 process' limit to 16384 for a few years (in `/etc/default/tomcat7`)
- Looks like cron will read limits from `/etc/security/limits.*` so we can do something for the tomcat7 user there
- Submit pull request for Tomcat 7 limits in Ansible dspace role ([#30](https://github.com/ilri/rmg-ansible-public/pull/30))

## 2016-04-05

- Reduce Amazon S3 storage used for logs from 46 GB to 6GB by deleting a bunch of logs we don't need!

```
# s3cmd ls s3://cgspace.cgiar.org/log/ > /tmp/s3-logs.txt
# grep checker.log /tmp/s3-logs.txt | awk '{print $4}' | xargs s3cmd del
# grep cocoon.log /tmp/s3-logs.txt | awk '{print $4}' | xargs s3cmd del
# grep handle-plugin.log /tmp/s3-logs.txt | awk '{print $4}' | xargs s3cmd del
# grep solr.log /tmp/s3-logs.txt | awk '{print $4}' | xargs s3cmd del
```

- Also, adjust the cron jobs for backups so they only backup `dspace.log` and some stats files (.dat)
- Try to do some metadata field migrations using the Atmire batch UI (`dc.Species` → `cg.species`) but it took several hours and even missed a few records

## 2016-04-06

- A better way to move metadata on this scale is via SQL, for example `dc.type.output` → `dc.type` (their IDs in the metadatafieldregistry are 66 and 109, respectively):

```
dspacetest=# update metadatavalue set metadata_field_id=109 where metadata_field_id=66;
UPDATE 40852
```

- After that an `index-discovery -bf` is required
- Start working on metadata migrations, add 25 or so new metadata fields to CGSpace

## 2016-04-07

- Write shell script to do the migration of fields: https://gist.github.com/alanorth/72a70aca856d76f24c127a6e67b3342b
- Testing with a few fields it seems to work well:

```
$ ./migrate-fields.sh
UPDATE metadatavalue SET metadata_field_id=109 WHERE metadata_field_id=66
UPDATE 40883
UPDATE metadatavalue SET metadata_field_id=202 WHERE metadata_field_id=72
UPDATE 21420
UPDATE metadatavalue SET metadata_field_id=203 WHERE metadata_field_id=76
UPDATE 51258
```

## 2016-04-08

- Discuss metadata renaming with Abenet, we decided it's better to start with the center-specific subjects like ILRI, CIFOR, CCAFS, IWMI, and CPWF
- I've e-mailed CCAFS and CPWF people to ask them how much time it will take for them to update their systems to cope with this change

## 2016-04-10

- Looking at the DOI issue [reported by Leroy from CIAT a few weeks ago](https://www.yammer.com/dspacedevelopers/#/Threads/show?threadId=678507860)
- It seems the `dx.doi.org` URLs are much more proper in our repository!

```
dspacetest=# select count(*) from metadatavalue where metadata_field_id=74 and text_value like 'http://dx.doi.org%';
 count
-------
  5638
(1 row)

dspacetest=# select count(*) from metadatavalue where metadata_field_id=74 and text_value like 'http://doi.org%';
 count
-------
     3
```

- I will manually edit the `dc.identifier.doi` in [10568/72509](https://cgspace.cgiar.org/handle/10568/72509?show=full) and tweet the link, then check back in a week to see if the donut gets updated

## 2016-04-11

- The donut is already updated and shows the correct number now
- CCAFS people say it will only take them an hour to update their code for the metadata renames, so I proposed we'd do it tentatively on Monday the 18th.

## 2016-04-12

- Looking at quality of WLE data (`cg.subject.iwmi`) in SQL:

```
dspacetest=# select text_value, count(*) from metadatavalue where metadata_field_id=217 group by text_value order by count(*) desc;
```

- Listings and Reports is still not returning reliable data for `dc.type`
- I think we need to ask Atmire, as their documentation isn't too clear on the format of the filter configs
- Alternatively, I want to see if I move all the data from `dc.type.output` to `dc.type` and then re-index, if it behaves better
- Looking at our `input-forms.xml` I see we have two sets of ILRI subjects, but one has a few extra subjects
- Remove one set of ILRI subjects and remove duplicate `VALUE CHAINS` from existing list ([#216](https://github.com/ilri/DSpace/pull/216))
- I decided to keep the set of subjects that had `FMD` and `RANGELANDS` added, as it appears to have been requested to have been added, and might be the newer list
- I found 226 blank metadatavalues:

```
dspacetest# select * from metadatavalue where resource_type_id=2 and text_value='';
```

- I think we should delete them and do a full re-index:

```
dspacetest=# delete from metadatavalue where resource_type_id=2 and text_value='';
DELETE 226
```

- I deleted them on CGSpace but I'll wait to do the re-index as we're going to be doing one in a few days for the metadata changes anyways
- In other news, moving the `dc.type.output` to `dc.type` and re-indexing seems to have fixed the Listings and Reports issue from above
- Unfortunately this isn't a very good solution, because Listings and Reports config should allow us to filter on `dc.type.*` but the documentation isn't very clear and I couldn't reach Atmire today
- We want to do the `dc.type.output` move on CGSpace anyways, but we should wait as it might affect other external people!

## 2016-04-14

- Communicate with Macaroni Bros again about `dc.type`
- Help Sisay with some rsync and Linux stuff
- Notify CIAT people of metadata changes (I had forgotten them last week)

## 2016-04-15

- DSpace Test had crashed, so I ran all system updates, rebooted, and re-deployed DSpace code

## 2016-04-18

- Talk to CIAT people about their portal again
- Start looking more at the fields we want to delete
- The following metadata fields have 0 items using them, so we can just remove them from the registry and any references in XMLUI, input forms, etc:
	- dc.description.abstractother
	- dc.whatwasknown
	- dc.whatisnew
	- dc.description.nationalpartners
	- dc.peerreviewprocess
	- cg.species.animal
- Deleted!
- The following fields have some items using them and I have to decide what to do with them (delete or move):
	- dc.icsubject.icrafsubject: 6 items, mostly in CPWF collections
	- dc.type.journal: 11 items, mostly in ILRI collections
	- dc.publicationcategory: 1 item, in CPWF
	- dc.GRP: 2 items, CPWF
	- dc.Species.animal: 6 items, in ILRI and AnGR
	- cg.livestock.agegroup: 9 items, in ILRI collections
	- cg.livestock.function: 20 items, mostly in EADD
- Test metadata migration on local instance again:

```
$ ./migrate-fields.sh
UPDATE metadatavalue SET metadata_field_id=109 WHERE metadata_field_id=66
UPDATE 40885
UPDATE metadatavalue SET metadata_field_id=203 WHERE metadata_field_id=76
UPDATE 51330
UPDATE metadatavalue SET metadata_field_id=208 WHERE metadata_field_id=82
UPDATE 5986
UPDATE metadatavalue SET metadata_field_id=210 WHERE metadata_field_id=88
UPDATE 2456
UPDATE metadatavalue SET metadata_field_id=215 WHERE metadata_field_id=106
UPDATE 3872
UPDATE metadatavalue SET metadata_field_id=217 WHERE metadata_field_id=108
UPDATE 46075
$ JAVA_OPTS="-Xms512m -Xmx512m -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8" ~/dspace/bin/dspace index-discovery -bf
```

- CGSpace was down but I'm not sure why, this was in `catalina.out`:

```

```

- Everything else in the system looked normal (50GB disk space available, nothing weird in dmesg, etc)
- After restarting Tomcat a few more of these errors were logged but the application was up

## 2016-04-19

- Get handles for items that are using a given metadata field, ie `dc.Species.animal` (105):

```
# select handle from item, handle where handle.resource_id = item.item_id AND item.item_id in (select resource_id from metadatavalue where resource_type_id=2 and metadata_field_id=105);
   handle
-------------
 10568/10298
 10568/16413
 10568/16774
 10568/34487
```

- Delete metadata values for `dc.GRP` and `dc.icsubject.icrafsubject`:

```
# delete from metadatavalue where resource_type_id=2 and metadata_field_id=96;
# delete from metadatavalue where resource_type_id=2 and metadata_field_id=83;
```

- They are old ICRAF fields and we haven't used them since 2011 or so
- Also delete them from the metadata registry
- CGSpace went down again, `dspace.log` had this:

```
2016-04-19 15:02:17,025 ERROR org.dspace.storage.rdbms.DatabaseManager @ SQL connection Error -
org.apache.commons.dbcp.SQLNestedException: Cannot get a connection, pool error Timeout waiting for idle object
```

- I restarted Tomcat and PostgreSQL and now it's back up
- I bet this is the same crash as yesterday, but I only saw the errors in `catalina.out`
- Looks to be related to this, from `dspace.log`:

```
2016-04-19 15:16:34,670 ERROR org.dspace.rest.Resource @ Something get wrong. Aborting context in finally statement.
```

- We have 18,000 of these errors right now...
- Delete a few more old metadata values: `dc.Species.animal`, `dc.type.journal`, and `dc.publicationcategory`:

```
# delete from metadatavalue where resource_type_id=2 and metadata_field_id=105;
# delete from metadatavalue where resource_type_id=2 and metadata_field_id=85;
# delete from metadatavalue where resource_type_id=2 and metadata_field_id=95;
```

- And then remove them from the metadata registry

## 2016-04-20

- Re-deploy DSpace Test with the new subject and type fields, run all system updates, and reboot the server
- Migrate fields and re-deploy CGSpace with the new subject and type fields, run all system updates, and reboot the server
- Field migration went well:

```
$ ./migrate-fields.sh
UPDATE metadatavalue SET metadata_field_id=109 WHERE metadata_field_id=66
UPDATE 40909
UPDATE metadatavalue SET metadata_field_id=203 WHERE metadata_field_id=76
UPDATE 51419
UPDATE metadatavalue SET metadata_field_id=208 WHERE metadata_field_id=82
UPDATE 5986
UPDATE metadatavalue SET metadata_field_id=210 WHERE metadata_field_id=88
UPDATE 2458
UPDATE metadatavalue SET metadata_field_id=215 WHERE metadata_field_id=106
UPDATE 3872
UPDATE metadatavalue SET metadata_field_id=217 WHERE metadata_field_id=108
UPDATE 46075
```

- Also, I migrated CGSpace to using the PGDG PostgreSQL repo as the infrastructure playbooks had been using it for a while and it seemed to be working well
- Basically, this gives us the ability to use the latest upstream stable 9.3.x release (currently 9.3.12)
- Looking into the REST API errors again, it looks like these started appearing a few days ago in the tens of thousands:

```
$ grep -c "Aborting context in finally statement" dspace.log.2016-04-20
21252
```

- I found a recent discussion on the DSpace mailing list and I've asked for advice there
