## 2016-01-13

- Move ILRI collection `10568/12503` from `10568/27869` to `10568/27629` using the [move_collections.sh](https://gist.github.com/alanorth/392c4660e8b022d99dfa) script I wrote last year.
- I realized it is only necessary to clear the Cocoon cache after moving collections—rather than reindexing—as no metadata has changed, and therefore no search or browse indexes need to be updated.
- Update GitHub wiki for documentation of [maintenance tasks](https://github.com/ilri/DSpace/wiki/Maintenance-Tasks).
