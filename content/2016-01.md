## 2016-01-13

- Move ILRI collection `10568/12503` from `10568/27869` to `10568/27629` using the [move_collections.sh](https://gist.github.com/alanorth/392c4660e8b022d99dfa) script I wrote last year.
- I realized it is only necessary to clear the Cocoon cache after moving collections—rather than reindexing—as no metadata has changed, and therefore no search or browse indexes need to be updated.
- Update GitHub wiki for documentation of [maintenance tasks](https://github.com/ilri/DSpace/wiki/Maintenance-Tasks).

## 2016-01-14

- Update CCAFS project identifiers in input-forms.xml
- Run system updates and restart the server

## 2016-01-18

- Change "Extension material" to "Extension Material" in input-forms.xml (a mistake that fell through the cracks when we fixed the others in DSpace 4 era)

## 2016-01-19

- Work on tweaks and updates for the social sharing icons on item pages: add Delicious and Mendeley (from Academicons), make links open in new windows, and set the icon color to the theme's primary color ([#157](https://github.com/ilri/DSpace/issues/157))
- Tweak date-based facets to show more values in drill-down ranges ([#162](https://github.com/ilri/DSpace/issues/162))
- Need to remember to clear the Cocoon cache after deployment or else you don't see the new ranges immediately
