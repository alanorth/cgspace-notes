Linode sent an alert that CGSpace (linode18) was using 350% CPU for the past two hours
I looked in the Activity pane of the Admin Control Panel and it seems that Google, Baidu, Yahoo, and Bing are all crawling with massive numbers of bots concurrently (~100 total, mostly Baidu and Google)
The good thing is that, according to dspace.log.2017-08-01, they are all using the same Tomcat session
This means our Tomcat Crawler Session Valve is working
But many of the bots are browsing dynamic URLs like:


/handle/10568/3353/discover
/handle/10568/16510/browse

The robots.txt only blocks the top-level /discover and /browse URLs&hellip; we will need to find a way to forbid them from accessing these!
Relevant issue from DSpace Jira (semi resolved in DSpace 6.0): https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-2962
It turns out that we&rsquo;re already adding the X-Robots-Tag &quot;none&quot; HTTP header, but this only forbids the search engine from indexing the page, not crawling it!
Also, the bot has to successfully browse the page first so it can receive the HTTP header&hellip;
We might actually have to block these requests with HTTP 403 depending on the user agent
Abenet pointed out that the CGIAR Library Historical Archive collection I sent July 20th only had ~100 entries, instead of 2415
This was due to newline characters in the dc.description.abstract column, which caused OpenRefine to choke when exporting the CSV
I exported a new CSV from the collection on DSpace Test and then manually removed the characters in vim using g/^$/d
Then I cleaned up the author authorities and HTML characters in OpenRefine and sent the file back to Abenet

<li>Magdalena from CCAFS asked if there was a way to get the top ten items published in 2016 (note: not the top items in 2016!)</li>
<li>I think Atmire&rsquo;s Content and Usage Analysis module should be able to do this but I will have to look at the configuration and maybe email Atmire if I can&rsquo;t figure it out</li>
<li>I had a look at the moduel configuration and couldn&rsquo;t figure out a way to do this, so I <a href="https://tracker.atmire.com/tickets-cgiar-ilri/view-tickets">opened a ticket on the Atmire tracker</a></li>
<li>Atmire responded about the <a href="https://tracker.atmire.com/tickets-cgiar-ilri/view-ticket?id=500">missing workflow statistics issue</a> a few weeks ago but I didn&rsquo;t see it for some reason</li>
<li>They said they added a publication and saw the workflow stat for the user, so I should try again and let them know</li>

<ul>
<li>Usman from CIFOR emailed to ask about the status of our OAI tests for harvesting their DSpace repository</li>
<li>I told him that the OAI appears to not be harvesting properly after the first sync, and that the control panel shows an &ldquo;Internal error&rdquo; for that collection:</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/cgspace-notes/2017/08/cifor-oai-harvesting.png" alt="CIFOR OAI harvesting" /></p>

<ul>
<li>I don&rsquo;t see anything related in our logs, so I asked him to check for our server&rsquo;s IP in their logs</li>
<li>Also, in the mean time I stopped the harvesting process, reset the status, and restarted the process via the Admin control panel (note: I didn&rsquo;t reset the collection, just the harvester status!)</li>
</ul>
