<li>We&rsquo;ll need to check for browse links and handle them properly, including swapping the <code>subject</code> parameter for <code>systemsubject</code> (which doesn&rsquo;t exist in Discovery yet, but we&rsquo;ll need to add it) as we have moved their poorly curated subjects from <code>dc.subject</code> to <code>cg.subject.system</code></li>
<li>The second link was a direct link to a bitstream which has broken due to the sequence being updated, so I told him he should link to the handle of the item instead</li>

<li>Working on the nginx redirects for CGIAR Library</li>
<li>We should start using 301 redirects and also allow for <code>/sitemap</code> to work on the library.cgiar.org domain so the CGIAR System Organization people can update their Google Search Console and allow Google to find their content in a structured way</li>
<li>Remove eleven occurrences of <code>ACP</code> in IITA&rsquo;s <code>cg.coverage.region</code> using the Atmire batch edit module from Discovery</li>
<li>Need to investigate how we can verify the library.cgiar.org using the HTML or DNS methods</li>
<li>Run corrections on 143 ILRI Archive items that had two <code>dc.identifier.uri</code> values (Handle) that Peter had pointed out earlier this week</li>
<li>I used OpenRefine to isolate them and then fixed and re-imported them into CGSpace</li>
<li>I manually checked a dozen of them and it appeared that the correct handle was always the second one, so I just deleted the first one</li>

<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;ll post it to the Yammer group to see what people think</li>
<li>I figured out at way to do the HTML verification for Google Search console for library.cgiar.org</li>
<li>We can drop the HTML file in their XMLUI theme folder and it will get copied to the webapps directory during build/install</li>
<li>Then we add an nginx alias for that URL in the library.cgiar.org vhost</li>
<li>This method is kinda a hack but at least we can put all the pieces into git to be reproducible</li>
<li>I will tell Tunji to send me the verification file</li>

<ul>
<li>Deploy logic to allow verification of the library.cgiar.org domain in the Google Search Console (<a href="https://github.com/ilri/DSpace/pull/343">#343</a>)</li>
<li>After verifying both the HTTP and HTTPS domains and submitting a sitemap it will be interesting to see how the stats in the console as well as the search results change (currently 28,500 results):</li>

<li>Peter added me as an owner on the CGSpace property on Google Search Console and I tried to submit a &ldquo;Change of Address&rdquo; request for the CGIAR Library but got an error:</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/cgspace-notes/2017/10/search-console-change-address-error.png" alt="Change of Address error"></p>
<ul>
<li>We are sending top-level CGIAR Library traffic to their specific community hierarchy in CGSpace so this type of change of address won&rsquo;t workâ€”we&rsquo;ll just need to wait for Google to slowly index everything and take note of the HTTP 301 redirects</li>
<li>Also the Google Search Console doesn&rsquo;t work very well with Google Analytics being blocked, so I had to turn off my ad blocker to get the &ldquo;Change of Address&rdquo; tool to work!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2017-10-12">2017-10-12</h2>
<ul>
<li>Finally finish (I think) working on the myriad nginx redirects for all the CGIAR Library browse stuffâ€”it ended up getting pretty complicated!</li>
<li>I still need to commit the DSpace changes (add browse index, XMLUI strings, Discovery index, etc), but I should be able to deploy that on CGSpace soon</li>

<li>Merge changes adding a search/browse index for CGIAR System subject to <code>5_x-prod</code> (<a href="https://github.com/ilri/DSpace/pull/344">#344</a>)</li>
<li>I checked the top browse links in Google&rsquo;s search results for <code>site:library.cgiar.org inurl:browse</code> and they are all redirected appropriately by the nginx rewrites I worked on last week</li>

<li>Run system updates on DSpace Test and reboot server</li>

<ul>
<li>In the last 24 hours we&rsquo;ve gotten a few alerts from Linode that there was high CPU and outgoing traffic on CGSpace</li>
<li>Uptime Robot even noticed CGSpace go &ldquo;down&rdquo; for a few minutes</li>
<li>In other news, I was trying to look at a question about stats raised by Magdalena and then CGSpace went down due to SQL connection pool</li>
<li>Looking at the PostgreSQL activity I see there are 93 connections, but after a minute or two they went down and CGSpace came back up</li>
<li>Annnd I reloaded the Atmire Usage Stats module and the connections shot back up and CGSpace went down again</li>
<li>Still not sure where the load is coming from right now, but it&rsquo;s clear why there were so many alerts yesterday on the 25th!</li>

<li>I still have no idea what was causing the load to go up today</li>

<li>I think it might have been an issue with the statistics not being fresh</li>
<li>I added the admin group for the systems organization to the admin role of the top-level community of CGSpace because I guess Sisay had forgotten</li>
<li>Magdalena asked if there was a way to reuse data in item submissions where items have a lot of similar data</li>
<li>I told her about the possibility to use per-collection item templates, and asked if her items in question were all from a single collection</li>
<li>We&rsquo;ve never used it but it could be worth looking at</li>

<ul>
<li>Linode alerted about high CPU usage again on CGSpace around 2AM and 4AM</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m still not sure why this started causing alerts so repeatadely the past week</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t see any tell tale signs in the REST or OAI logs, so trying to do rudimentary analysis in DSpace logs:</li>

<li>So there were 2049 unique sessions during the hour of 2AM</li>
<li>Looking at my notes, the number of unique sessions was about the same during the same hour on other days when there were no alerts</li>
<li>I think I&rsquo;ll need to enable access logging in nginx to figure out what&rsquo;s going on</li>
<li>After enabling logging on requests to XMLUI on <code>/</code> I see some new bot I&rsquo;ve never seen before:</li>

<li>CORE seems to be some bot that is &ldquo;Aggregating the worldâ€™s open access research papers&rdquo;</li>

<li>After browsing the CORE site it seems that the CGIAR Library is somehow a member of CORE, so they have probably only been harvesting CGSpace since we did the migration, as library.cgiar.org directs to us now</li>
<li>For now I will just contact them to have them update their contact info in the bot&rsquo;s user agent, but eventually I think I&rsquo;ll tell them to swap out the CGIAR Library entry for CGSpace</li>

<li>At least we know the top two are CORE, but who are the others?</li>
<li>190.19.92.5 is apparently in Argentina, and 104.196.152.243 is from Google Cloud Engine</li>
<li>Actually, these two scrapers might be more responsible for the heavy load than the CORE bot, because they don&rsquo;t reuse their session variable, creating thousands of new sessions!</li>

<li>From looking at the requests, it appears these are from CIAT and CCAFS</li>
<li>I wonder if I could somehow instruct them to use a user agent so that we could apply a crawler session manager valve to them</li>
<li>Actually, according to the Tomcat docs, we could use an IP with <code>crawlerIps</code>: <a href="https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/config/valve.html#Crawler_Session_Manager_Valve">https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/config/valve.html#Crawler_Session_Manager_Valve</a></li>
<li>Ah, wait, it looks like <code>crawlerIps</code> only came in 2017-06, so probably isn&rsquo;t in Ubuntu 16.04&rsquo;s 7.0.68 build!</li>
<li>That would explain the errors I was getting when trying to set it:</li>

<li>As for now, it actually seems the CORE bot coming from 137.108.70.6 and 137.108.70.7 is only using a few sessions per day, which is good:</li>

<li>Very nice, Linode alerted that CGSpace had high CPU usage at 2AM again</li>
<li>Ask on the dspace-tech mailing list if it&rsquo;s possible to use an existing item as a template for a new item</li>
<li>To follow up on the CORE bot traffic, there were almost 300,000 request yesterday:</li>

<li>I&rsquo;ve emailed the CORE people to ask if they can update the repository information from CGIAR Library to CGSpace</li>
<li>Also, I asked if they could perhaps use the <code>sitemap.xml</code>, OAI-PMH, or REST APIs to index us more efficiently, because they mostly seem to be crawling the nearly endless Discovery facets</li>
<li>I added <a href="https://goaccess.io/">GoAccess</a> to the list of package to install in the DSpace role of the <a href="https://github.com/ilri/rmg-ansible-public">Ansible infrastructure scripts</a></li>
<li>It makes it very easy to analyze nginx logs from the command line, to see where traffic is coming from:</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code># goaccess /var/log/nginx/access.log --log-format=COMBINED

<li>According to Uptime Robot CGSpace went down and up a few times</li>
<li>I had a look at goaccess and I saw that CORE was actively indexing</li>
<li>Also, PostgreSQL connections were at 91 (with the max being 60 per web app, hmmm)</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m really starting to get annoyed with these guys, and thinking about blocking their IP address for a few days to see if CGSpace becomes more stable</li>
<li>Actually, come to think of it, they aren&rsquo;t even obeying <code>robots.txt</code>, because we actually disallow <code>/discover</code> and <code>/search-filter</code> URLs but they are hitting those massively:</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code># grep &#34;CORE/0.6&#34; /var/log/nginx/access.log | grep -o -E &#34;GET /(discover|search-filter)&#34; | sort -n | uniq -c | sort -rn 
 158058 GET /discover
  14260 GET /search-filter
</code></pre><ul>
<li>I tested a URL of pattern <code>/discover</code> in Google&rsquo;s webmaster tools and it was indeed identified as blocked</li>
<li>I will send feedback to the CORE bot team</li>
</ul>
