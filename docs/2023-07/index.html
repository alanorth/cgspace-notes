<li>Export CGSpace to check for missing Initiative collection mappings</li>
<li>Start harvesting on AReS</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2023-07-02">2023-07-02</h2>
<ul>
<li>Minor edits to the <code>crossref_doi_lookup.py</code> script while running some checks from 22,000 CGSpace DOIs</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2023-07-03">2023-07-03</h2>
<ul>
<li>I analyzed the licenses declared by Crossref and found with high confidence that ~400 of ours were incorrect
<ul>
<li>I took the more accurate ones from Crossref and updated the items on CGSpace</li>
<li>I took a few hundred ISBNs as well for where we were missing them</li>
<li>I also tagged ~4,700 items with missing licenses as &ldquo;Copyrighted; all rights reserved&rdquo; based on their Crossref license status being TDM, mostly from Elsevier, Wiley, and Springer</li>
<li>Checking a dozen or so manually, I confirmed that if Crossref only has a TDM license then it&rsquo;s usually copyrighted (could still be open access, but we can&rsquo;t tell via Crossref)</li>
<li>I would be curious to write a script to check the Unpaywall API for open access status&hellip;</li>
<li>In the past I found that their <em>license</em> status was not very accurate, but the open access status might be more reliable</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>More minor work on the DSpace 7 item views
<ul>
<li>I learned some new Angular template syntax</li>
<li>I created a custom component to show Creative Commons licenses on the simple item page</li>
<li>I also decided that I don&rsquo;t like the Impact Area icons as a component because they don&rsquo;t have any visual meaning</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2023-07-04">2023-07-04</h2>
<ul>
<li>Focus group meeting with CGSpace partners about DSpace 7</li>
<li>I added a themed file selection component to the CGSpace theme
<ul>
<li>It displays the bistream description instead of the file name, just like we did in DSpace 6 XMLUI</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I added a custom component to show share icons</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2023-07-05">2023-07-05</h2>
<ul>
<li>I spent some time trying to update OpenRXV from Angular 9 to 10 to 11 to 12 to 13
<ul>
<li>Most things work but there are some minor bugs it seems</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mishell from CIP emailed me to say she was having problems approving an item on CGSpace
<ul>
<li>Looking at PostgreSQL I saw there were a dozen or so locks that were several hours and even over one day old so I killed those processes and told her to try again</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2023-07-06">2023-07-06</h2>
<ul>
<li>Types meeting</li>
<li>I wrote a Python script to check Unpaywall for some information about DOIs</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2023-07-7">2023-07-7</h2>
<ul>
<li>Continue exploring Unpaywall data for some of our DOIs
<ul>
<li>In the past I&rsquo;ve found their <em>licensing</em> information to not be very reliable (preferring Crossref), but I think their <em>open access status</em> is more reliable, especially when the provider is listed as being the publisher</li>
<li>Even so, sometimes the version can be &ldquo;acceptedVersion&rdquo;, which is presumably the author&rsquo;s version, as opposed to the &ldquo;publishedVersion&rdquo;, which means it&rsquo;s available as open access on the publisher&rsquo;s website</li>
<li>I did some quality assurance and found ~100 that were marked as Limited Access, but should have been Open Access, and fixed a handful of licenses</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Delete duplicate metadata as describe in my DSpace issue from last year: <a href="https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/issues/8253">https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/issues/8253</a></li>
<li>Start working on some statistics on AGROVOC usage for my presenation next week
<ul>
<li>I used the following SQL query to dump values from all subject fields and lower case them:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console"><span style="display:flex;"><span>localhost/dspacetest= ☘ \COPY (SELECT DISTINCT(lower(text_value)) AS &#34;subject&#34; FROM metadatavalue WHERE dspace_object_id in (SELECT dspace_object_id FROM item) AND metadata_field_id IN (187, 120, 210, 122, 215, 127, 208, 124, 128, 123, 125, 135, 203, 236, 238, 119)) to /tmp/2023-07-07-cgspace-subjects.csv WITH CSV HEADER;

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>Time: 2564.851 ms (00:02.565)
</span></span></code></pre></div><ul>
<li>Then I extracted the subjects and looked them up against AGROVOC:</li>
</ul>

</span></span></code></pre></div><ul>
<li>I did some more tests with Angular 13 on OpenRXV and found out why the repository type dropdown wasn&rsquo;t working
<ul>
<li>It was because of a missing 1-line JSON file in the data directory, which is runtime data, not code</li>
<li>I copied the data directory from the production serve and rebuild and the site is working well now</li>
<li>I did a full harvest with plugins and it worked!</li>
<li>So it seems Angular 13.4.0 will work, yay</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2023-07-08">2023-07-08</h2>
<ul>
<li>Export CGSpace to check for missing Initiative collection mappings
<ul>
<li>Start a harvest on AReS</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The AGROVOC lookup finished, so I checked the number of matches:</li>

</span></span></code></pre></div><ul>
<li>So that&rsquo;s 12,528 out of 26,443 unique terms (47.3%)</li>
<li>I did a LOT of work on the OpenRXV frontend build dependencies to bring more in line with Angular 13</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2023-07-10">2023-07-10</h2>
<ul>
<li>I did a lot more work on OpenRXV to test and update dependencies</li>
<li>I deployed the latest version on the production server</li>

<li>CGSpace upgrade meeting with Americas and Africa group</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2023-07-13">2023-07-13</h2>
<ul>
<li>Michael Victor asked me to help Aditi extract some information from CGSpace
<ul>
<li>She was interested in journal articles published between 2018 and 2023 with a range of subjects related to drought, flooding, resilience, etc</li>
<li>I used an advanced query with some AGROVOC terms:</li>
</ul>
</li>
