<li>Minor edits to the <code>crossref_doi_lookup.py</code> script while running some checks from 22,000 CGSpace DOIs</li>

<ul>
<li>I analyzed the licenses declared by Crossref and found with high confidence that ~400 of ours were incorrect
<ul>
<li>I took the more accurate ones from Crossref and updated the items on CGSpace</li>
<li>I took a few hundred ISBNs as well for where we were missing them</li>
<li>I also tagged ~4,700 items with missing licenses as &ldquo;Copyrighted; all rights reserved&rdquo; based on their Crossref license status being TDM, mostly from Elsevier, Wiley, and Springer</li>
<li>Checking a dozen or so manually, I confirmed that if Crossref only has a TDM license then it&rsquo;s usually copyrighted (could still be open access, but we can&rsquo;t tell via Crossref)</li>
<li>I would be curious to write a script to check the Unpaywall API for open access status&hellip;</li>
<li>In the past I found that their <em>license</em> status was not very accurate, but the open access status might be more reliable</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>More minor work on the DSpace 7 item views
<ul>
<li>I learned some new Angular template syntax</li>
<li>I created a custom component to show Creative Commons licenses on the simple item page</li>
<li>I also decided that I don&rsquo;t like the Impact Area icons as a component because they don&rsquo;t have any visual meaning</li>
